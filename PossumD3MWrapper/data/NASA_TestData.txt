1~AFTER takeoff ON runway _ A loudnoise WAS hear come FROM FRONT AREA OF aircraft.FOR A WHILE I AND CREW THOUGHT IT WAS THE AIR drive generate THAT deploy FROM right NOSE OF aircraft.UPON FURTHER troubleshoot FOUND THAT THE AIR drive generate COULD NOT HAVE deploy DUE TO ABSENCE OF icon AND message ON THE engineindicationandcrewalertingsystem system.WE immediate return TO THE airport FOR AN UNEVENTFUL land.FURTHER examine AT THE GATE show THE OXYGEN accesspanel pop OPEN AFTER takeoff cause THE NOISE.PRIOR TO flight THE normalpreflight show NO AJAR OR OPEN panel ON THE aircraft.moderateturbulence WAS encounter AFTER takeoffdue TO STRONG crosswind AND lowlevelwindshearadvisories IN EFFECT.
2~taxi OFF THE parkingramp THE brake system fail TO STOP THE aircraft.LATER determine TO BE A BAD TRUNION SWITCH IN THE right maingear NEITHER pilot HAD ani control OVER THE aircraft speed AND DUE TO frequencycongestion WE COULD NOT ALERT ground OF OUR problem.BECAUSE OF THIS WE WERE UNABLE TO HOLD SHORT OF THE control PORTION OF THE airport.THE INCURSION ON THE taxiway DID NOT PUT US IN DANGER OF collide WE DID BLOCK AN intersect AFTER WE coast TO A STOP.ground WAS immediate notify AND COMPANY WAS call TO GET A TUG AND BRING US BACK TO THE RAMP.I HAVE NEVER see train TO DEAL WITH brakefailure ON THE ground IN AN aircraft BUT I SURE WOULD LIKE TO.
3~airworthinessdirective _ DUE EACH _ hour TO GREASE BLOWER bear.inspect TAILROTOR DRIVE SHAFT THOMAS COUPLINGS AND check TORQUE ON TAILROTOR GEARBOX MOUNT student nut.inspect DUE aircraft totaltime _ HAS airworthinessdirective sign OFF AT _ hour inspect DUE AT aircraft totaltime _ accomplish AT _.date occur number _ september _ september _.NO OTHER occur note TO THIS DATE MAY _.remind mechanic THAT airworthinessdirective MUST BE accomplish AT OR BEFORE hi DUE AND NO OVERFLY allow.mechanic realize IT WAS AN OVERSIGHT ON hi PART AND IS WELL AWARE OF NO OVERFLY IS allow.
4~ON descend clear TO _ feet.captain SET _ feet IN alert.I readback _ feet.go THROUGH _ feet WE WERE TOLD TO climb BACK TO _ feet.approach ask US TO CALL THEM ON TELEPHONE.TAPE show WE HAD BEEN clear TO _ feet.ALSO show WE readback _ feet.control WAS decertify.THIS happen AT THE END OF A longday _ hour.
5~AN UNUSUAL ODOR WAS note IN THE COCKPIT BY flightcrew.A FEW minute LATER THE flightattendant notify THE CREW THAT SHE notice SMOKE IN THE CABIN.THE captain THEN verify visual THAT THERE WAS SMOKE IN THE CABIN.airtrafficcontrol WAS notify of the situate AND THAT AN IMMEDIATE land WAS NECESSARY.THE aircraft WAS land AND passenger WERE evacuate FROM aircraft.THEY WERE THEN buss TO TERMINAL.
6~ON preflight IN msp airport FOUND firstofficer south radiomagneticindicator OUT OF SYNCH AND correct IT.flight WAS NORMAL TO LSE.ON preflight THE nextmorning FOUND radiomagneticindicator OUT OF SYNCH AGAIN.look THROUGH LOGBOOK FOR HISTORY OF problem AND FOUND openwriteup THAT HAD BEEN place ON WRONG PAGE.notify maintain control.cancel flight AND ferry aircraft TO dtw airport.
7~IN ORDER TO EXPEDITE departure AND ENHANCE THE FLOW OF traffic tower IS permit TO ASSIGN A vectorheading TO turbopropaircraft WHICH DIVERGES FROM THE head ON THE DRK IDP.AT A POINT _ mile east OF THE airport THE IDP head CONVERGES WITH THE allow vectorheading.IN THIS CASE THE _ assignedheading _ degree FROM runway converge ON THE _.DUE TO TERRAIN MVA requirement turn WERE NOT initial us.visualseparation WAS provide BY THE _ pilot WHICH prevent A LOSS OF STANDARD instrumentflightrulesseparation.
8~JUST PRIOR TO depart OF aircraft flight XXX RAMP supervise CAME INTO COCKPIT WITH FORM FOR captain TO SIGN.IT WAS AN aircraft FORM WITH OUR aircraft AND flightnumber proper MADE OUT state WE WERE carry A BOX WITH A RADIOACTIVE SUBSTANCE AND IT HAD BEEN place IN THE REAR CARGO.I READ THE instruct ON THE aircraft FORM sign IT AND follow THE direct ON THE FORM DISPOSITION.on PART WENT TO THE rampperson AND THE OTHER WAS TO BE PUT IN THE flight envelop TO BE retain FOR _ day.IT DID NOT DAWN ON ME THAT THIS mirror procedure DID NOT APPLY TO THE aircraft aircraft UNTIL OUR land IN BOSTON realize THAT WE HAD carry unauthorized hazardousmaterial ON A shuttleaircraft.WE AT THE SHUTTLE HAVE BEEN give A GREAT NUMBER OF operate change IN form AND procedure WITH NO FORMAL train.IT come IN bulletin OR revise WITH NO explain EXCEPT THAT WE ARE attempt TO MIRROR AS MANY procedure AS POSSIBLE.IT IS A dangeroussituation TO HAVE standard THAT ARE CONTRARY TO EACH OTHER AT THE SAME AIRLINE.IT IS EVEN WORSE WHEN THEY ARE HAPHAZARDLY implement AND IS VERY confuse TO THE AVERAGE crewmember.ALSO lead TO MY confuse IS THAT I HAD BEEN schedule FOR _ SCHOOL ON august _ THAT WAS subsequent POSTPONED.I HAD BEEN study aircraft procedure IN prepare FOR THE transit AND IN THAT MATERIAL THIS WAS A properprocedure.THE responsible TO CARRY THE BOX WAS sole MINE.I MADE A MISTAKE BUT I DO FEEL strong THAT I WAS setup BY THE circumstance AND THAT I AM IN THE MIDDLE OF A transit OF operate certificate WITHOUT clear direct.
9~selectivecalling FROM sfo airport commercialradio.THEY state airtrafficcontrol clear aircraft X TO _ _ _ _ TOU.I readback exact THAT TO commercialradio.PRIOR TO THAT WE WERE go TO ORNAI.WE THOUGHT THAT clearance mean TO PROCEED DIRECT TO _ _ WHICH WE DID.approximate _ minute LATER WE check IN WITH VANCOUVER center WITH positionreport.HE ask OUR clearance WHICH WE readback TO HIM.HE indicate WE WERE clear THAT rout AFTER ORNAI.control state THERE WAS NO trafficconflict OR separate problem SO THERE WAS NO problem WITH HIM.WE proceed ON WITH NO FURTHER problem.supplementalinformation FROM airborneclassificationnumber _ THE RADIO WAS VERY broke AND WE ask THAT THE clearance BE repeat.WE repeat THE clearanceback AND ask FOR confirm.THEY say ROGER.THE CULPRIT HERE WAS THE extreme POOR highfrequency connect.
10~aircraft seem TO ACCELERATE normal.AT approximate _ feet DOWN THE runway THE aircraft stop accelerate AROUND _ knotsindicatedairspeed.AT approximate _ feet WITH ONLY _ feet OR LESS remain THE aircraft WAS ONLY indicate _ knot.AT THAT POINT I elect TO ABORT SINCE OUR v1speed WAS _ knot.WE check OUR number AND TOOK OFF ON oppose runway WITHOUT FURTHER INCIDENT.WE SUSPECT UNDETECTED WINDSHEAR wind WERE report AS LIGHT AND vary thunderstorm IN AREA.SUGGEST WINDSHEAR DATA BE check.
11~HAD taxi OUT TO runway _ FOR takeoff PER prevail east WIND AND OTHER traffic have JUST clear runway _ AFTER land.RADIO announcement WERE MADE BY MY STUDENT DURING ALL TAXI AND takeoff procedure.on OTHER aeronauticaladvisorystation transmit WAS note WHICH refer TO ITSELF ONLY BY number AND locate north OF IOSCO airport.no identify OF it typeaircraft WAS MADE.AFTER VISUAL SCAN reveal NO OTHER traffic WE proceed FOR A normaltakeoff.DURING climbout altitude _ feetabovegroundlevel JUST oppose THE RAMP midfield WE SAW A heliport AT OUR _ o'clock posit AT OUR altitude ON A head OF approximate _ degree AT rang OF ABOUT _ feet.IT WAS APPARENT THAT THE heliport WAS intend TO approach FOR A land ON THE RAMP cross THE activerunway AT ALMOST _ degree AT VERY lowaltitude WITHOUT us THE STANDARD airport trafficpattern.THIS ALMOST result IN A midaircollision.THE heliport COULD HAVE identify HIMSELF AS SUCH fly AT A higheraltitude RATHER THAN THE _ feet ABOVE treetop LEVEL THAT MADE HIM INVISIBLE TO US AND HE COULD HAVE fly A STANDARD approach PATTERN.THERE ARE sever noradio airplane THAT OPERATE AT _ AND WOULD HAVE HAD NO warn EITHER IN this situate.
12~THIS WAS A train JUMP FOR A firsttime skydive STUDENT.FOR THIS JUMP _ accelerate freefall rate instructor WOULD ACCOMPANY THE STUDENT THROUGH preflight.THE dropzone AREA WAS clear AND visualflightrules.THERE WAS A cloudlayer ABOUT _ nauticalmile UPWIND IE east OF THE dropzone.THE aircraft WAS ON JUMP RUN WELL BEFORE THE dropzone.WHILE climb OUT THE instructor AND STUDENT TOOK MUCH long THAN USUAL.BY THE TIME THEY WERE READY TO JUMP WE HAD fly OVER THE cloudlayer.INSTEAD OF climb BACK INTO THE PLANE AND start OVER THE instructor initiate THE JUMP.AS A RESULT THEY WENT THROUGH THE cloud.NOT ONLY IS THIS A violate of federalaviationregulation _ IT IS ALSO IN violate OF USPA BASIC safe requirement AND OTHER skydive regulate.THE instructor WERE TOLD THAT THEY exercise extreme poorjudgement IN jump WITH A STUDENT THROUGH cloud.THEY agree AND WOULD DO A betterjob IN plan THEIR JUMP RUN.
13~be vector FOR A land ON runway THE control instruct US TO TUNE IN AND contacttower.I mistake look AT THE towerfrequency FOR runway.WHEN WE contact tower THE control clear US TO LAND ON runway.WE question THE clearance SINCE WE WERE be vector AND expect clearance FOR runway AT phx airport.WE WERE AGAIN clear TO LAND ON runway.WE sidestep TO THE right AND land WITHOUT INCIDENT.UPON taxi TO OUR GATE THE groundcontrol ask US WHO clear US TO LAND.WE respond THE tower.THE captain WAS THEN request TO CONTACT THE towerchief BY PHONE.HE HAD A converse WITH THE towerchief.WE surprise THE approach control BY land ON A differentrunway THAN HE HAD vector US TO.THE towercontroller DID NOT QUESTION US AND JUST clear US TO LAND ON hi runway WHEN WE contact HIM.THERE WAS NO trafficconflict fortunate.
14~approach sns airport veryhighfrequencyomnidirectionalradiorange ON ROBIE _ arrive INTO sjc airport WAS TOLD BY ZOA TO PROCEED DIRECT TO KLIDE intersect sjc airport _ degree RADIAL _ distancemeasuringequipment AND INTERCEPT THE locate runway.ALTHOUGH WE intend TO DO THAT WE INSTEAD TOOK UP A head THAT WOULD TAKE US TO A POINT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FIELD IE THE sjc airport _ degree RADIAL _ distancemeasuringequipment.DURING handoff TO approach approachcontrol realize WE WEREN T proceed AS direct.THEY THEN direct US TO TURN right TO A head TO INTERCEPT THE locate.NO trafficconflict result.WHEN airtrafficcontrol clear US TO KLIDE THE pilotnotflying ME try TO PROGRAM KLIDE INTO THE flightmanagementcomputer.KLIDE WAS NOT IN THE DATABASE SO I HAD TO ENTER THE intersect AS A RADIAL AND distancemeasuringequipment.THE pilotflying firstofficer say ENTER sjc airport _ degree RADIAL _ nauticalmile FIX.I DID THAT AND WE THEN turn TO A head THAT WOULD TAKE US TO WHAT I THOUGHT WAS KLIDE.NEITHER OF US realize THAT WE HAD enter THE inboundcourse RATHER THAN THE RADIAL.WE WERE proceed ON A head TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FIELD.contribute factor _ KLIDE NOT IN DATABASE._ captain NOT think WHEN HE enter WHAT THE firstofficer TOLD HIM TO ENTER._ highworkload occur WELL INTO descend WHEN A LOT OF thing WERE happen._ NOT look AT THE head AND ask doe IT MAKE SENSE.A GLANCE AT THE approach CHART SHOULD HAVE SHOWN head TO BE between _ degree FROM sns airport AND NOT THE _ degree head WE WERE fly.LESSON learn pilotnotflying SHOULD backup AND NOT JUST ENTER WHAT THE firstofficer say.
15~WE WERE fly west enroute TO FMY AT _ feet visualflightrules.MOONEY WAS northeastbound collide WOULD HAVE occur IF WE DID NOT INITIATE SHARP descend.WE immediate initiate flight follow.
16~give UNPUBLISHED HOLD HOLD west ON _ degree RADIAL bjc airport _ distancemeasuringequipment STUDENT turn SECOND omnibearingselector TO outboundheading.discuss open attention TO altitude LOST moment _ feet HIGH.control call return TO _ feet.PAY attention.
17~DURING depart climb OFF runway _ groundproximitywarningsystemwarning TERRAIN WHOOP WHOOP sound FROM plus or minus _ distancemeasuringequipment TO _ distancemeasuringequipment between plus or minus _ feetmeansealevel.radaraltimeter descend TO plus or minus _ feet DURING THIS PERIOD.LSE airportanalysis WAS us include publish _ feet MINIMUM LEVELOFF accelerate altitude.ALL aircraft system WERE operate normal AND STANDARD depart PROFILE follow.aircraft pass OVER bluff eastsoutheast OF airport.aircraft WAS plus or minus _ pound UNDER allowabletakeoffweight.HAD THIS occur IN instrumentmeteorologicalconditions OR DURING singleengine emergency THERE WOULD BE CAUSE FOR CONCERN.
18~WHILE descend FOR approach TO iah airport center GAVE US A cross restrict OF _ feet AT _ knot southeast OF NAVASOTA TNV.I AM quit SURE HE modify THIS TO _ feet.I readback THE newaltitude WHICH I BELIEVE HE confirm BUT WHEN I check IN WITH approach THE control WAS surprise TO FIND OUT I WAS AT _ feet INSTEAD OF _ feet.NOW _ feet IS THE NORMAL altitude THAT WE ARE hand OVER TO approachcontrol AND I THINK THAT center MAY HAVE MADE A MISTAKE AND GAVE US THAT OUT OF HABIT.THAT DAY thing WERE IRREGULAR BECAUSE OF weather.WE WERE be vector AND OUR NORMAL arrive WAS NOT IN us.
19~WHEN clear FOR takeoff captain advance power AND autothrottle WERE arm power NORMAL.I call _ knot THROTTLE HOLD AND THEN notice THE right generate OFF LIGHT ON engineindicationandcrewalertingsystem.IT WAS NEAR _ knot AND I immediate advise THE captain WHO abort THE takeoff.speed WAS NEAR _ knot.I call tower AND advise THEM THAT WE WERE abort.THEY want US TO CONTINUE PAST runway AND TURN right ON runway _.WE DID THAT AND ask IF WE COLD GO TO THE runway PAD AND assess the situate.tower advise TO STAY WHERE WE WERE IT WAS OK.I call maintain AND RAMP FOR A GATE.WE move TO THE runway PAD AND ORD operate CAME BY AND advise THAT _ tire WERE FLAT.AFTER THAT THERE WAS NO QUESTION OF ani TAXI.operate AND maintain handle THE remove OF THE passenger WHO WERE CALM AND DIDN T SEEM UPSET BY THE ABORT.THE captain MADE A gooddecision IN THE shorttime HE HAD TO EVALUATE THE inform.HE keep EVERYONE inform OF WHAT WAS go ON AND DID A SUPER JOB.HE coordinate THE CREW activity AND handle THE SIT AS IF IT WAS NORMAL.supplementalinformation FROM airborneclassificationnumber _ maintain LATER inform US THAT THE FUSE plug HAD deflate THE tire.passenger AND CREW deplane AT THE PAD.
20~POSSIBLE veryhighfrequencyomnidirectionalradiorangesignal RADIAL problem _ collocate veryhighfrequencyomnidirectionalradiorange and tacticalairnavigation.locate approximate SLI _ degree RADIAL _ distancemeasuringequipment.WHILE climb TO _ feet ON THE PRADO _ depart WE WERE TOLD BY airtrafficcontrol THAT WE WERE _ mile north OF COURSE.BOTH OUR veryhighfrequencyomnidirectionalradiorange WERE SET ON THE SLI _ degree RADIAL AND show centerline.AFTER A FEW minute airtrafficcontrol THEN turn US right TO A head OF _ degree.TOLD airtrafficcontrol WE indicate centerline.NO LOSS OF separate WAS mention.THIS samesituation HAS happen AT LEAST _ OR _ time TO ME IN JUST ABOUT THE SAME posit.COME TO FIND OUT THE firstofficer HAS experience THIS ALSO _ time ON THE PRADO _ OUT OF ont airport.PERHAPS THERE IS AN electric distort AND OR receive problem IN THIS AREA.PERHAPS IT WAS A CELL PHONE OR OTHER electric DEVICE IN THE CABIN.WE mention THIS TO THE flightattendant HOWEVER SHE recall NOTHING UNUSUAL.WE WERE NOT us GPS lateralnavigation AT THE TIME.
21~ON september _ I receive A CALL FROM MY COMPANY south CHIEF OF maintain inform ME THAT A flight ON august _ MADE BY ME IN THE ABOVE aircraft WAS AFTER THE annualinspection DATE OF july _.THIS aircraft IS us BY THE pilot OF OUR cpr airport flightdepartment FOR please AND private BUSINESS fly.IT IS NOT us FOR cpr airport TRANSPORT AND WAS NOT include ON A statusboard OR IN A computersystem AS THE cpr airport jet ARE.I REALIZE THAT IT IS THE pilot south responsible TO ENSURE THE airworthy OF THE aircraft.I HAVE BECOME accustom TO THE maintenancedepartment track inspect DUE date AND ensure comply.IT NEVER occur TO ME TO check THE logbook OF THIS aircraft.I HAVE spoke WITH THE maintain CHIEF AND THE follow change HAVE BEEN MADE._ A STATUS SHEET WITH THE NECESSARY inspect inform FROM THE logbook WILL BE carry IN THE aircraft._ statusboard WILL BE install IN THE maintain AREA TO MONITOR THIS aircraft._ NEW SOFTWARE PROGRAM HAS BEEN purchase THAT WILL ALLOW THE STATUS OF ALL companyaircraft TO BE monitor include THIS on us FOR person fly._ THE CHIEF OF maintain WILL CONDUCT A train SESSION WITH ALL cpr airport pilot TO ENSURE EVERYONE IS AWARE OF THE change be implement AND THE import OF ensure airworthy PRIOR TO flight.
22~WHILE descend INTO PAP WE receive A trafficadvisory warn AT ABOUT _ feet.WE level AT _ feet AND MADE visualcontact WITH A JET depart PAP runway _.HE call HE HAD THE trafficadvisory warn AND WE report WE HAD THE traffic IN SIGHT.THE trafficadvisory cancel AS WE level AT _ feet.WE pass BY THE traffic WITH MORE THAN _ feet verticalseparation AND MORE THAN _ mile horizontalseparation.WE WERE previous clear ON A VISUAL approach TO runway _.I SUSPECT THE HIGH descend RATE combine WITH THE HIGH climb RATE WAS A majorfactor.
23~airtrafficcontrol advise clear FOR takeoff climb TO _ feet ON runwayheading.AT approximate _ feet THE control advise MAINTAIN _ feet DUE TO traffic.THE aircraft WAS climb approximate _ FPM.WE THEN level OFF AT _ feet assoonaspossible.THE control THEN GAVE A clearance TO climb TO _ feet AND CONTACT ZNY.I readback frequency BUT advise I HAD traffic _ o'clock AND LESS THAN _ mile ON trafficalertandcollisionavoidancesystem _ AT _ feet.THE control THEN say CONTACT ZNY AND climb TO _ feet AGAIN.I refuse AND call ZNY AND TOLD HIM THE SIT.HE say STAY AT _ feet THAT I DID HAVE instrumentflightrulestraffic AT _ feet LESS THAN _ mile oppositedirection.NOTE THE firstofficer WAS fly AND ONCE THE control clear US TO _ feet HE initiate A climb BUT stop AT _ feet AS trafficalertandcollisionavoidancesystem _ WENT TO resolutionadvisory MODE AND command A verticalspeed descend.HE firstofficer level AT _ feet ON MY COMMAND ALONG WITH resolutionadvisory OF trafficalertandcollisionavoidancesystem _.I THINK THE control AT MCGUIRE EITHER miss THE traffic OFF hi SCREEN OR WAS JUST A badjudgement CALL ON BEHALF OF MCGUIRE depart control.THE trafficalertandcollisionavoidancesystem _ save THE DAY IN MY BOOK INVALUABLE equip.
24~I report FOR DUTY AT A maintenancefacility WHERE WORK HAD BEEN accomplish ON OUR PLANE.THE aircraft HAD ALREADY BEEN return TO serve BY THE COMPANY indicate TO ME THAT maintain perform AS WELL AS associate PAPERWORK HAD BEEN receive AND WORK perform WAS suffice TO PLACE THE aircraft BACK INTO serve.base ON _ _ year EXPERIENCE WITH THE COMPANY IT IS MY EXPERIENCE THAT AN aircraft IS NEVER return TO serve UNLESS ALL require PAPERWORK IS receive AND review FOR COMPLETENESS AND accurate.PRIOR TO say TRIP I talk WITH _ differ MECHS WHO state ALL PAPERWORK HAD BEEN pass TO THE COMPANY.THE mechanic show ME AN aircraft RELEASE FORM.THE FORM state THAT THE wheelassembly TIE bolt fail A TORQUE TEST DURING DISASSEMBLY REASSEMBLY.THIS concern ME.I ask THE mechanic WHAT THAT mean AND express MY CONCERN OVER WHAT ramification THIS fail WOULD POSE FOR ME operation AND IF THE PLANE WAS IN FACT OK TO FLY.THE mechanic assure ME THAT THE wheel WOULD BE FINE AND THAT ALL IT mean WAS WHILE THE PROPER TORQUE WAS NOT attain THERE WAS certain ENOUGH TORQUE provide TO HOLD EVERYTHING TOGETHER.THE mechanic TOLD ME HE HAD PUT SOME TORQUE STRIPE ON say bolt IN AN EFFORT TO AID THE crew BY give THEM A visualreference IF THERE WAS ani move IN bolt OR nut ON THE WHEEL HUB.I ask THE mechanic HOW OFTEN I SHOULD check THE TORQUE STRIPE AND WHEN THE bolt SHOULD BE change.THE mechanic ask HOW MANY land WE DO EACH DAY.I TOLD HIM WE CAN DO AS MANY AS _ EACH DAY.mechanic say AT THAT RATE check ONCE A DAY WOULD BE suffice WHICH I DID PRIOR TO firstflight.I sign THE aircraft RELEASE FORM AND MADE A person NOTE TO MYSELF TO ASK OUR companymechanic ABOUT THE TIE bolt.ALL indication TOLD ME I HAD AN aircraft READY TO flyin AN airworthycondition.MY sign THE aircraft RELEASE FORM WAS NOTHING MORE THAN AN acknowledge OF THE writeup ITSELF.incident THE FORM ask FOR A pilot south NOT A mechanic south SIGNATURE.I FEEL THE maintain LINE remove AND SUBSEQUENT OK FOR aircraft returntoservice constitute OFFICIAL aircraft RELEASE AND I TOOK THE PLANE.WE HAD AN uneventfultakeoff AND land AT OUR destinate._ hour LATER ON taxiout WE experience deflate OF BOTH tire ON THE right MAIN land GEAR AND APPARENT HUB fail.aircraft HAD TO BE tow BACK TO RAMP._ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ THE report state IT WAS ODD have TO SIGN A PAPER AFTER THE maintain RELEASE WAS issue.THE report WAS NOT AT EASE ABOUT THE explain OF THE WHEEL TIE bolt LOW TORQUE AND THE require FOR A day recheck AND WITH NO deferredmaintenance ITEM address THE TIE BOLT CONDITION.THE report say LATER HE WAS advise THIS WAS AN airworthinessdirective AND IF THE TIE BOLT TORQUE WAS FOUND LOW THE bolt MUST BE replace BEFORE flight.
25~BOTH pilot assume THAT takeoff WOULD BE ON runway.HOWEVER WE WERE give A taxiclearance FROM GATE XA TO runway _.NO SPECIFIC taxiway WERE issue WITH THIS clearance.ON taxiway V I WAS headsdown final weightandbalance AND flightmanagementcomputer duty.AS THE captain MADE THE NEXT left TURN AND question THE wide OF THE taxiway I look UP AND realize THAT WE WERE ON taxiway F.I THEN READ HIM THE publish _ pound weigh restrict.OUR TAXI FOR takeoff continue ON taxiway F AND taxiway G WITHOUT INCIDENT.taxiway B AND _ SHOULD VE BEEN us.DURING A RETURN flight TO grr airport I notice THAT THE EASTERN ENTRANCE TO taxiway G IS mark WITH A light SIGN generalaviation ONLY.THERE IS NO SUCH SIGN AT THE ENTRANCE TO taxiway F.
26~WHILE cruise AT flightlevel approximate _ mile west OF light THE flightattendant call bywayof INTERCOM AND advise OF A SMOKE SMELL IN THE CABIN.THE flightattendant request assist.firstofficer WENT INTO THE CABIN TO INVESTIGATE.UPON RETURN TO THE flightdeck firstofficer advise OF smell A SMELL WHEN leave THE flightdeck BUT find NO SMOKE ODOR OR problem IN THE CABIN.JUST PRIOR TO THE CALL FROM THE flightattendant I observe THE STANDBY PITCH TRIM indicate MOVE FROM _ TO THE FULL DOWN posit AND RETURN TO THE _ posit.approximate _ minute LATER THE flightattendant call AGAIN bywayof INTERCOM AND advise THE SMELL HAD return TO THE CABIN.THE flightattendant request MY assist.I enter THE CABIN AND NEITHER smell OR observe ANYTHING UNUSUAL.THIS INTERCOM CALL WAS ALSO precede BY THE STANDBY PITCH TRIM indicate move FROM _ TO THE FULL DOWN posit AND RETURN TO THE _ posit.UPON MY RETURN TO THE flightdeck I discuss THE TRIM AND option WITH THE firstofficer.I THEN call airtrafficcontrol request PRIORITY DIRECT dfw airport ALSO inquire ABOUT THE near suit airport DUE TO OUR altitude AND WE WERE show _ minute TO dfw airport.I decide THAT WAS THE bestcourse OF ACTION.I THEN call DISPATCH MOC AND discuss THE TRIM SIT.I WAS advise TO PULL circuitbreaker _.THIS WAS DONE AND NO FURTHER UNUSUAL TRIM indication WERE observe.WHEN switchedover TO region approachcontrol I WAS give A VECTOR TO _ degree.I advise THE control I need DIRECT dfw airport AND WOULD DECLARE IF THAT WERE NECESSARY.THE control ask FOR soul AND FUEL onboard.land ON runway AT dfw airport WAS UNEVENTFUL.exit THE runway AT taxiway _ I call THE CABIN AND verify EVERYTHING WAS ALL RIGHT WHILE THE firedepartment look OVER THE aircraft.I WAS THEN ask MY intent.I NEXT receive A hydraulic CWP LIGHT WITH A SINGLE STROKE CHIME.I observe ZERO hydraulicquantity ZERO MAIN ACCUMULATOR PRESSURE AND ZERO OUTBOARD BRAKE ACCUMULATOR PRESSURE.I feather AND shutdown THE left engine notify THE tower AND INBOUND I COULD NOT MOVE THE aircraft AND request A TOW FROM INBOUND.WHILE wait FOR THE passenger BUS TO ARRIVE I RAN THE right engine FOR aircraft AND electricalpower.I receive AN left DUCT ZERO temperature indicatorlight AND THE DUCT temperature WAS peg ON THE HIGH SIDE.call FOR THE DUCT overtemperature checklist AND secure THE righthand HP BLEED._ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ON CALLBACK report state THAT HE WAS NOT AWARE IF maintain HAD BEEN ABLE TO LOCATE THE SOURCE FOR THE ODOR OR SMOKE AS report BY THE flightattendant.IN add report state THAT ALTHOUGH THE STANDBY PITCH TRIM indicate move IN AN ERRATIC MANNER IT HAD NO bear WHATEVER WITH THE ODOR OF SMOKE OR THE control OF THE elevate.IN FACT THIS IS NOT AN INFREQUENT occur AND IS AN ANOMALY associate WITH THE TYPE OF indicate.report FURTHER state THAT HE TOOK AGGRESSIVE brake ACTION AFTER land WITH NO explain WHY HE feel THE NEED FOR maximumperformance STOP.IT WAS AFTER THE aircraft taxi clear OF THE runway WHEN THE pilot WAS alert TO THE LOSS OF PRESSURE AND THEN FLUID.probable AS A RESULT OF HARD brake.report doe NOT KNOW OF THE FINAL determine FROM maintain AS TO THE SOURCE OF THE ODOR AND HE believe THE aircraft WAS PUT BACK INTO serve AFTER AN inspect AND maintenanceaction ON THE brake.callbackconversation WITH report OF airborneclassificationnumber _ reveal THE followinginformation THE firstofficer indicate THAT SHE WAS THE pilotflying ON A SAAB _ DURING THIS LEG AND THAT dfw airport WAS THEIR destinate.SHE review THE maintain writeup AND FOUND NOTHING FOR AN extendedperiod.recent SHE FOUND A new enter writeup indicate THAT maintain HAD replace THE aircondition pack BEFORE THE flight IN QUESTION.THE firstofficer describe THE ODOR AS be chemic RATHER THAN AN electric SMELL SOMEWHAT LIKE bake good.THE hydraulicfluid LOSS THAT THEY experience UPON land WAS AN UNASSOCIATED problem AS WAS THE STANDBY PITCH indicate MALFUNCTION.THERE HAD BEEN NO previouswriteup ON THE hydraulic NOR ON THE PITCH indicate.THE firstofficer state.
27~cruise flightlevel ZTL TOLD US TO FLY head _ degree WHICH WAS A _ degree left TURN FROM OUR ON courseheading.short THEREAFTER ZTL ask US OUR head WHICH WAS pass _ degree.AT THAT MOMENT WE receive A trafficalertandcollisionavoidancesystem _ ALERT TO descend approximate _ FPM TO AVOID head on traffic.
28~depart dfw airport WITH _ STAGE MOD VALVE placard inoperative.minimumequipmentlist require number _ PACK AND BLEED BE close FOR takeoff AND REINSTATED WITH number _ BLEED AFTER _ feet.WE DID THAT AND CABIN BECAME uncontrolled.IT fluctuate UP AND DOWN _ feet.WE level AT _ feet AND begin TO TROUBLESHOOT system.NO combine OF bleed OR pack WOULD STABILIZE CABIN.AFTER consult maintenancetechnician WE decide TO RETURN TO dfw airport.WE WERE _ pound OVER OUR land weigh.WE advise airtrafficcontrol receive A VECTOR AND begin TO DUMP FUEL TO OUR land weigh.WE return TO dfw airport WITHOUT FURTHER problem._ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ THE report state THE aircraft WAS dispatch WITH THE number _ PNEUMATIC BLEED system inoperative AND defer PER THE minimumequipmentlist.THE report say THE number _ PNEUMATIC BLEED system HAD A PREVIOUS HISTORY OF PNEUMATIC problem AND HAD JUST BEEN repair.THE report say THE number _ BLEED system fail IN climb AND result IN A RETURN TO THE FIELD.
29~clear aircraft X TO descend TO _ feet ON runway locate speed _ knot.AT approximate _ feet airtrafficcontrol advise US OF visualflightrules CESSNA CENTURION traffic clear TO _ feet LEVELOFF AT _ feet.begin LEVELOFF AT _ feet AND advise approach THAT THE CESSNA aircraft Y WAS climb THROUGH _ feet approximate _ mile AT _ o'clock posit.approach instruct US TO descend AND simultaneous WE GOT A trafficadvisory resolutionadvisory THAT command A _ plus FPM RATE OF descend.WE push THE noseover AND I report THAT WE WERE respond TO A trafficadvisory resolutionadvisory.I CANNOT SAY FOR CERTAIN HOW CLOSE WE GOT BUT IT HAD TO BE LESS THAN _ mile AND LESS THAN _ feet verticalseparation.THE control work US say HE WOULD CALL OVER AND FIND OUT WHO clear THE CESSNA THROUGH US.A sidenote I GOT A VISUAL ON THE CESSNA AT LESS THAN _ mile AND HE WAS IN AND OUT OF THE SAME broke LAYER WE WERE IN AT _ feet SO HE SHOULD AT LEAST HAVE TO EXPLAIN HOW HE maintain visualflightrules.CRISIS OVER OR SO WE THOUGHT A frequency CHANGE TO _ I BELIEVE AND THIS GUY slow US FROM approximate _ knot TO _ knot TO _ knot IN rapidsuccession TO FIT AN airtransportradio ABOUT _ mile IN FRONT OF US brief THE aircraft full AND NOT say A WORD TO US UNTIL I ask EVEN THOUGH WE WERE overtake THE airtransportradio rapid.AT LEAST WE SAW THE airtransportradio A LITTLE IN ADVANCE AND know THAT THE speedreduction need TO BE A QUICK on.I overlook A COUPLE OF OTHER similaroccurrence IN THE PAST COUPLE OF month BUT THIS WAS WAY TOO CLOSE AND I THINK I SEE A danger TREND develop AT dfw airport.supplementalinformation FROM airborneclassificationnumber _ approach inform US OF visualflightrulestraffic AT _ o'clock AT _ feet.THERE WERE cloud AT _ feet.apparent THE visualflightrulestraffic WAS get advisory ON ANOTHER frequency AND THE control DID INDICATE HE WAS go TO ASK WHY THE visualflightrulestraffic WAS IN A climb.WE WERE ONLY ABOUT _ mile FROM traffic AT samealtitude.
30~aircraft X WAS enroute TO ORD AT flightlevel.aircraft Y WAS enroute TO teb airport AT flightlevel.aircraft Y request flightlevel.I HAD traffic AT flightlevel BUT I ALSO HAD traffic AT flightlevel THAT WAS converge WITH aircraft yso I climb HIM TO flightlevel temporary.I know aircraft X WAS traffic FOR aircraft yso I turn aircraft X TO A _ degree head think THIS WOULD BE ABOUT A _ degree left TURN.I WAS BUSY WITH OTHER thing AND aircraft X HAD AN resolutionadvisory WHICH bring THE SIT TO MY attention.AT THIS TIME THE _ aircraft HAD ALMOST pass AND THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD DO.
31~depart FROM RHV TO sjc airport I WAS clear TO LAND ON runway BUT I request runway _.BUT THEY GAVE ME runway AGAIN AND I WAS TOO CLOSE TO TURN ONTO FINAL FOR runway.SO I descend BELOW THE aircraft ON FINAL WHICH I HAD IN SIGHT AND THEN land ON runway _.factor unfamiliarairport.I WOULD HAVE like TO crossover THE airport TO ENTER THE PATTERN FOR runway _ HOWEVER MAYBE THE ceil WAS TOO LOW FOR THE tower TO GIVE THAT instruct.ENGLISH IS SECOND LANGUAGE.
32~ON descend INTO phx airport ON FOSSL _ arrive ZAB clear US TO CROSS TONTO intersect AT _ feet _ knot.IN THE MEANWHILE ZAB WAS VERY BUSY WITH traffic.AFTER A TIME ZAB ask US IF WE COULD START DOWN.THE copilot WAS fly THE LEG AND WE BOTH realize THAT ALTHOUGH WE WERE IN verticalnavigation THE altitude FOR TONTO HAD NOT BEEN dial IN THE WINDOW ON THE MCP AND WE WERE HIGH ON THE verticalnavigation PATH.WE WERE SCRAMBLING TO START DOWN WHEN ZAB ask US IF WE WOULD CONTACT on OF OUR SISTER FLTS TO GET THEM ON THE CORRECT frequency.between THE copilot AND MYSELF switch TO EITHER GUARD frequency PA AND aircraftcommunicationsaddressingandreportingsystem TO ATTEMPT CONTACT WITH THE SISTER flight AND accomplish OTHER duty AT vary time on OF US WAS OFF THE airtrafficcontrolfrequency.AFTER NOT raise OUR SISTER flight I CAME BACK ON ZAB AND hear OUR SISTER flight check IN WITH ZAB.ZAB WAS STILL VERY BUSY AND switch US TO _ approach JUST BEFORE TONTO.JUST PRIOR TO TONTO I notice THE altitudewindow IN THE MCP HAD BEEN dial TO _ feet AND THE aircraft WAS slow descend TO _ feet.AT ABOUT _ feet approach ask US IF WE WERE ALREADY descend TO _ feet.I respond WE WERE AS previous clear EVEN THOUGH I HAD NOT hear THAT airtrafficcontrolclearance IN THE confuse OF airtrafficcontrol CHATTER AND try TO RAISE OUR SISTER flight ON ANOTHER frequency.I WOULD NOT EVEN QUESTION THE altitudeclearance EXCEPT FOR approach south TONE IN question US UPON initialcontact.HE say NOTHING IN RETURN AND WE proceed TO descend TO _ feet.REST OF arrive NORMAL.
33~WE WERE give A descend TO _ feet.I READ THE clearanceback slow AND careful TO VERIFY _ feet.THE control DID NOT RESPOND WHICH IS NORMAL I assume WE HAD THE CORRECT altitude._ feet WAS NOT NORMAL FOR THIS rout OF flight WHICH IS WHY I READ IT BACK careful.LATER AFTER advise AT _ feet THE control WAS UNSURE OF THE altitude WE HAD BEEN assign AND query US.THE possible exist I COULD HAVE got THE altitude WRONG initial.I DON T THINK I WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR be OFF altitude THAT IS WHY I READ IT BACK.
34~AFTER level AT _ feet approach issue A descend TO _ feet.copilot WAS fly ON autopilot AND I THOUGHT HE SET _ feet IN MCP AND begin A verticalspeed descend.I readback OUT OF _ feet FOR _ feet.HE apparent hear _ feet AND SET THAT.I DIDN T CATCH THE ERROR THOUGH I THOUGHT WE BOTH point AT THE altitudewindow.HE THEN call FOR THE approach check WHICH I accomplish.WHEN IT WAS COMPLETE I notice THE aircraft level AT _ feet.I say WE RE ONLY clear TO _ feet AND ABOUT THAT TIME approachcontrol ask US OUR altitude.I respond WITH _ feet AND HE say TO MAINTAIN IT.trafficalertandcollisionavoidancesystem _ show traffic AT _ o'clock AT _ mile climb depart atl airport.THE clearance OUT OF ATLANTA IS TO _ feet AND WE NEVER lostseparation.I SUSPECT FATIGUE WAS A FACTOR IN THIS occur.WE HAD ALREADY fly FROM dfw airport TO lga airport switch plane AND experience A mechanicalproblem IN lga airport AFTER PUSHBACK.THIS involve A length PROCESS OF procedure radio minimumequipmentlist passenger ETC WHILE taxi AROUND A VERY busyairport AND result IN _ hour AWAY FROM THE GATE.THIS WAS follow BY ANOTHER aircraft SWAP AND MANY passenger concern.WE depart lga airport approximate _ hour LATE AND WERE PRETTY tire ON arrive IN atl airport.
35~WE depart dca airport ON runway _ WITH A clearance TO INTERCEPT THE dca airport _ degree RADIAL AND MAINTAIN _ feet.THE captain WAS handfly THE AIRPLANE WITH flightdirector command.DURING THE LAST _ feet OF THE climb WE WERE issue A left TURN TO THE east.I select THE headingbug TO THE newheading BUT DID NOT CANCEL THE previousflight direct COMMAND TO INTERCEPT THE _ degree RADIAL.WHILE IN THE TURN THE flightdirector capture THE _ degree RADIAL AND display THE correspond COMMAND.BOTH OF US WERE momentary distract WHILE WE try TO RECONCILE THE apparent conflictinginformation WE WERE receive FROM THE flightdirector IE THE rollbar indicate A right COMMAND WHEN I HAD select A head TO THE left.IN add WE WERE experience LIGHT TO moderateturbulence DURING THE climbout FROM lateafternoon thermal.AT _ feet WE hear THE altitude auralwarning.THE captain immediate arrest THE climb AND descend TO _ feet.THE maximumaltitude reach WAS ABOUT _ feet.THERE WAS NO trafficconflict observe ON trafficalertandcollisionavoidancesystem _.airtrafficcontrol DID NOT QUERY US AND JUST AS WE WERE level AT _ feet issue A clearance TO climb.THE pilotflying WAS PERHAPS distract by THE turbulent DURING THE climbout AS WELL AS THE APPARENT flightdirector DISCREPANCY JUST AT THE TIME WHEN HE WOULD normal BE level OFF.THIS KIND OF SIT CAN BE avoid IN THE FUTURE BY THE pilotflying concentrate ON aircraft control special WHILE handfly AND have THE pilotnotflying RESOLVE ani discrepancy.addition vigil BY THE pilotnotflying IN monitor THE flight PATH SHOULD ALSO BE exercise particular DURING highworkload period SUCH AS THIS.

37~THIS aircraft HAD AN minimumequipmentlist WHICH indicate THAT THE autopilot PITCH WAS UNRELIABLE AT highaltitude.autopilot PITCH prove UNRELIABLE IN descend AS WELL AND HAD A tend TO REDUCE descend EVEN WITH LEVEL CHANGE select ON flightguidancepanel.ON descend INTO bdl airport center usual give A cross restrict AT MAD OF _ feet ON THE _ arrive.WE WERE prepare FOR THIS BUT center mere clear US TO _ feet.UPON CHANGEOVER TO bdl airport approach THE control question WHY WE WERE NOT YET AT _ feet pass MAD.beside NOT have BEEN give THE cross restrict THE AIRPLANE HAD actual begin A climb TOWARD _ feet AS I look AWAY AT A CHART FOR A RADIAL TO FLY.NO CONFLICT develop WITH OTHER aircraft.
38~THE aircraft HAD _ OPEN item TO ADDRESS.THIS on WAS A CRACK IN THE right MAIN land geardoor.IT WAS remove PER AN engineer author confine deviate LIST CDL AND call FOR THE DOOR SEQUENCE VALVE TO BE secure IN THE DOOR openposition.THE engineer author DID NOT INCLUDE A PICTURE OR describe OF HOW TO ACCOMPLISH THIS.THERE WAS NO maintain MANUAL refer AND THE maintain MANUAL HAS NOTHING describe HOW TO ACCOMPLISH THIS procedure THAT COULD BE FOUND.WITHOUT document show HOW TO SECURE THE VALVE WITH THE DOOR OFF I WAS LEFT TO INTERPRET THE SIT BEST I COULD.THE USUAL PRESSURE TO RETURN AN aircraft TO serve AND AT THE begin OF THE SHIFT A maintain manage MADE A SPEECH TO ONLY _ OF _ crew AT WORK ON THE LINE indicate A SERIOUS INCREASE IN product WAS FORTHCOMING OR correctiveaction BY manage WOULD BE take.MY word THERE WAS ALSO SPECIFIC VERBAL PRESSURE TO GET THIS aircraft READY assoonaspossible reiterate BECAUSE WE move UP THE estimate TIME OF REPAIR EVEN THOUGH THERE WERE _ MORE aircraft IN vary state OF REPAIR.I M NOT imply THESE factor WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR MY DECISION TO SECURE THE VALVE IN THE DOOR upposition INSTEAD OF DOOR OPEN.BUT humanfactor be WHAT THEY ARE on isn airport T ALWAYS COGNIZANT OF ALL THE INFLUENCES IN make SOME decision.
39~I WAS THE copilot ON september _ _.DURING vector FOR THE instrumentlandingsystemrunway AT atl airport IT BECAME OBVIOUS THAT THERE WAS A thunderstorm AT THE FIELD.ONBOARD RADAR electronicflightmanagementsystem display RED radarreturn AT THE airport.THE captain WAS fly THE aircraft autopilot ON.I advise HIM I WAS AGAINST fly THE approach BY state I THINK WE SHOULD goaraound.HE elect TO CONTINUE.WE switch TO tower AT ABOUT BURNY finalapproachfix.I query tower ABOUT fieldcondition.THEIR respond WAS heavyrain THEN WINDSHEAR ALERT LOSS OF _ knot departureend.tower THEN issue A MICROBURST ALERT AT WHICH POINT I AGAIN TOLD THE captain TO goaraound.HE AGAIN overrule ME AND say HE WAS go TO LAND.WE touch DOWN IN clearair AND roll INTO heavyrain AT midfield.land WAS UNEVENTFUL.AT THE GATE I TOLD THE captain I DON T THINK WE SHOULD HAVE fly THE approach.hi respond WAS I WAS comfort AND I M THE captain.COMPANY MANUAL prohibit land WHEN A thunderstorm IS WITHIN _ nauticalmile OF THE intend flight PATH.IT ALSO prohibit land AFTER tower issue A MICROBURST ALERT.WHY DO pilot CONTINUE TO LAND IN thunderstorm.
40~automaticterminalinformationservice report instrumentlandingsystemrunway AND instrumentlandingsystemrunway.WE prepare FOR BOTH.AFTER be clear FOR instrumentlandingsystemrunway AND AT _ feet _ change THE approach TO instrumentlandingsystemrunway.THIS WAS NOT JUST A SIDESTEP BUT AN instrumentlandingsystem WITH altitude restrict.I alter MY head TO INTERCEPT runway.BY THE TIME WE HAD IT tune AND identify AND check altitude I WAS north OF runway locate.WE BOTH realize IT AT THE sametime AND AS I begin A left TURN TO INTERCEPT approach call AND say WE WERE north OF COURSE AND assignedheading _ degree TO INTERCEPT.I BELIEVE OUR perform degrade BY THE FACT WE WERE rush INTO prepare FOR A differ approach AT THE lastminute.lax airport tower AND _ SEEM TO BE JUGGLING aircraft AT CERTAIN time.previous I HAVE BEEN clear TO LAND ON _ differentrunway.
41~I TOOK OFF FROM OLYMPIA TO DO patternwork TOUCH AND go.tower TOLD ME TO FOLLOW ANOTHER aircraft.I WAS TO BE number _ AND THE OTHER aircraftnumber _.THE OTHER aircraft TOOK A LONG RUN PAST THE airport SO I turn IN FRONT OF IT WITHOUT remember I WAS suppose TO FOLLOW THE aircraft.I DID NOT COME CLOSE TO THE aircraft.tower note IT AND TOLD ME I HAD cutoff THE PLANE AND THAT I WAS suppose TO BE number _.I ask WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO AND HE say NOW YOU ARE number _ AND THE OTHER aircraft IS number _.HE ask THE OTHER aircraft IF IT COULD SEE ME.THEY confirm THAT THEY HAD ME IN SIGHT.NOTHING FURTHER WAS say.I WAS distract ON takeoff BY A malfunction TACHOMETER.

67~clear AS file CAPITAL _ depart _ feet.WHEN set OUR INITIAL climb altitude IN OUR altitudeselector IT WAS SET TO _ feet AS publish IN BOLD letter ON CAPITAL _ departurestandardinstrumentdeparture FOR iad airport.IN REGULAR PRINT IT say OR assignedaltitude.SOMEHOW MY firstofficer AND MYSELF miss THE _ feet ON OUR clearance AND WHEN WE DID OUR display check BOTH acknowledge _ feet AS PER CAPITAL _ depart.ON depart THE weather WAS turbulent rain AND wind WITH THE remnant OF A HURRICANE.WE depart runway AT iad airport.tower turn US OVER TO depart control.WE climb AT approximate _ FPM TO BEGIN OUR EXIT FROM THE moderateturbulence AND weather.WHEN MY firstofficer call depart AND WAS ABLE TO GET A WORD IN ON THE frequency HE state aircraft X _ feet FOR _ feet.THERE WAS NO ANSWER THAT TIME.HE try AGAIN AND say aircraft X climb TO _ feet.WE WERE TOLD WE WERE ON THE wrongfrequency AND WERE suppose TO leveloff AT _ feet.WE WERE AS HIGH AS _ feet BEFORE go BACK DOWN TO _ feet AND change frequency.WE immediate contact THE OTHER control ON THE OTHER frequency AND WERE clear TO _ feet WITHOUT EVENT.THIS WAS MY FAULT FOR SOMEHOW miss PLACEMENT OF OUR OTHER assignedaltitude IN OUR altitudeselector.I THINK IT WOULD BE benefit FOR ALL aircraft TO BE assign TO THE COMMON initialaltitude OF _ feet.IF IT WERE print SOMEWHERE ON THE standardinstrumentdeparture SUCH AS turboprop OR propel aircraft MAINTAIN _ feet AS see ON OTHER depart plate AND _ feet turbojet ONLY OR PERHAPS NOT have MAINTAIN _ feet IN BOLD letter BY ITSELF.
68~ON depart OUT OF msp airport WE WERE deviate FOR thunderstorm IN AREA.receive altitude CHANGE FROM flightlevel BACK TO flightlevel.HAD fail TO SET _ IN AT flightlevel.UPON level AT flightlevel center advise US altitude _ feet OFF.WE RESET ALTIMETER AND immediate correct BACK TO flightlevel.
69~ON THE secondleg OF _ LEG PART _ CHARTER TRIP WE WERE enroute TO THE armyairfield AT feet ben generalaviation.I WAS fly AND THE captain WAS perform THE pilotnotflyingduty.ABOUT _ mile FROM THE FIELD THE captain tune THE automaticterminalinformationservice.THE inform indicate THAT THE tower WAS close AND WOULD NOT OPEN UNTIL _.WE WERE approach THE FIELD AT approximate _.airportadvisory WERE avail THOUGH.WE receive currentweather FROM ZTL.I brief A veryhighfrequencyomnidirectionalradiorange approach TO THE FIELD.ZTL clear US FOR THE approach AND TOLD US TO CONTACT advise.THE captain tune THE publish advisoryfrequency AND attempt CONTACT.I DID NOT KNOW IF HE MADE CONTACT OR NOT BECAUSE HE WAS ON THE number _ RADIO.I WAS ON number _ RADIO.THE towerfrequency WAS tune IN number _.BUT tower WAS close.WE land uneventful AND DURING TAXI IN SOMEONE call US ON tower AND say WE need TO HAVE permit TO LAND.WE apologize AND taxi IN.WE AGAIN check THE automaticterminalinformationservice AND IT say THE tower WAS close.evident airportadvisory WERE ON towerfrequency BUT commercialchart DATA ON THE approach chart HAD A SEPARATE advisoryfrequency WHEN THE tower WAS close.WE SHOULD NOT HAVE land BECAUSE PART _ require CONTACT EVEN IF advise IN NATURE BEFORE land.SOME factor THAT WERE A FACTOR WERE A NIGHTTIME approach TO AN unfamiliarairport AND THE LATE hour OF THE CHARTER.I WILL BE MORE vigil TO THIS nexttime.
70~preflight AIRPLANE.HAD TO WAIT _ minute FOR fueltruck.fueltruck park _ feet direct IN FRONT OF aircraft.AIRPLANE refuel AND CREDIT CARD GAS PAYMENT DONE.sit IN pilotseat get flight MATERIAL arrange AND GAS TRUCK drive AWAY.PERHAPS _ minute AFTER pay start engine contact ground GOT permit TO TAXI AND move AIRPLANE approximate _ feet AND RAN INTO LADDER LEFT ON ground BY GAS TRUCK IN FRONT OF AIRPLANE.THIS result IN propel STRIKE.
71~ON september _ AT approximate _ I taxi ACROSS AN activerunway _ AT HECTOR intern FARGO ND.THERE WAS NO traffic IN THE PATTERN ON approach NOR ON ani taxiway.THE problem arise AS A RESULT OF us A NEW APPLICANT FOR THE firsttime TO SERVE IN MY PLACE AS AN intern CONTRACT pilot.THIS GENTLEMAN WAS FRENCH AND MY percept WAS THAT HE appear TO BE IN GOOD COMMAND OF THE LANGUAGE.WE WERE TO FLY FROM FARGO ND TO BRIDGEPORT CT THAT even.I ask HIM TO COPY THE clearance WHILE I taxiedto THE ACTIVE AND RAN THE taxichecklist.HE WAS UNABLE TO COPY THE clearance complete AND require MY assist.include DURING THE TAXI WAS A double check OF THE flightmanagementsystem DATA OF THE clearance WE HAD receive.I THEN ask HIM TO GET OUR taxiclearance.IT WAS AT THIS POINT THAT crewresourcemanagement begin TO UNRAVEL.contribute factor WERE MY LACK OF KNOWLEDGE AS TO hi ability AND A SERIOUS languagebarrier hi understand OF THE airtrafficcontrol LANGUAGE THAT lead direct TO THE INCURSION.I taxi OUT slow FROM THE RAMP BECAUSE OF MY unfamiliar WITH THE airport.I HAD open THE approach plate TO THE FARGO airportdiagram AND hand THE APPLICANT THE BOOK.WE WERE clear TO TAXI TO runway _ bywayof taxiway circuitbreaker AND HOLD SHORT OF runway _.THE copilotreadback THE taxiclearance WITHOUT THE HOLD SHORT instruct.THE tower interrogate hi READBACK request THE acknowledge OF THE HOLD SHORT.THE copilot respond A secondtime incorrect.apparent THE rapid OF THE spoke TONGUE AND A NEW express confuse HIM.I SAW hi problem AND transmit THE HOLD SHORT require.THE LANGUAGE communicate problem consume A FEW hundredfeet ON taxion taxiway C.BY THIS TIME I HAD taxi PAST THE taxiway B SIGNAGE.I ask MY copilot HOW WE WERE do SINCE WE WERE STILL taxi TO THE ACTIVE.HE HELD UP THE BOOK ABOUT _ feet AWAY FROM ME AND point TO taxiway C ON THE CHART AND THEN point TO THE taxiway ACROSS THE runway.I us poorjudgement AND fail TO double check THE LETTER assign TO THE taxiway AND mistake follow hi direct.WE continue TO TAXI WHILE I try TO EXPLAIN THE landandholdshortoperations regulate.I mention THAT THEY WERE AN effect PROGRAM TO control runwayincursion AND THAT IT WAS mandate TO REPLY AS TO THE HOLD SHORT instruct.HE thank ME FOR THE HELP AND inform.AS WE begin TO crossrunway _ THE tower call AND say THAT WE HAD miss OUR TURN THAT WE HAD BEEN clear taxiway circuitbreaker WITH A HOLD SHORT AT runway _ AND THAT WE WERE NOW cross THE activerunway _.HE TOLD US TO CONTINUE ACROSS AND TAXI left ON taxiway A.I feel SICK.correctiveaction WERE PRETTY SIMPLE AT THIS POINT.I TOOK THE approach plate AND handle ALL communicate.THE DAMAGE WAS DONE AND I WAS ANGRY AT MYSELF FOR allow THIS TO HAPPEN.THE APPLICANT IS ON hi WAY TO TAHITI.
72~flight test new install CARGO HOOK.ON approach BACK INTO stage AREA AT _ feetabovegroundlevel HOOK inadvertent release jettison THE TEST LOAD.LOAD FELL ABOUT _ feet INTO openfield.NO DAMAGE TO aircraft OR equip OR PROPERTY ON THE ground.UPON closerinspection IT WAS FOUND MANUAL RELEASE CABLE WAS bind IN BELLY clamp AND MANUAL RELEASE CABLE WAS NOT adjust proper.THE combine OF BOTH problem result IN THE INADVERTENT RELEASE OF THE LOAD.THE RELEASE happen _ minute INTO THE TEST flight.IF I HAD JUST pick UP THE LOAD AND SET IT BACK DOWN THE problem WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN FOUND.THIS INCIDENT REINFORCES THE NEED FOR A THOROUGH AND COMPLETE TEST flight OF new install equip.
73~WAS clear TO LAND ON runway _ land runway _.approach vector TO LAND WE WERE line UP WITH runway _.WE WERE clear TO LAND.WE mistake clear _ FOR _ degree head AND land runway _.tower advise HE allow US TO CONTINUE DUE TO lightwind AND LACK OF OTHER traffic.A REVIEW OF head IS IN ORDER.
74~aircraft X WAS LEVEL AT flightlevel DIRECT aircraftcertificationoffice AND aircraft Y WAS ON A head AND descend FOR sequence INTO cle airport approach AIRSPACE.separate WAS LOST between THE _ aircraft.traffic WAS VERY COMPLEX AND BUSY AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT.
75~enroute FROM _ I WAS clear TO transit THROUGH FALCON FIELD south classdairspace AND frequency CHANGE TO SCOTTSDALE tower WAS approve.AS I approach SCOTTSDALE A FAST move thunderstorm obscure THE mountain cause ME TO RETHINK MY PLAN AND turnaround AND LAND AT FALCON FIELD.I DID MY BEST TO AVOID THE weather MAINTAIN visualflightrules AND REMAIN clear OF THE phx airport classb AIRSPACE.HOWEVER I AM SOMEWHAT UNCERTAIN IF I actual DID STAY clear OF THE classb AIRSPACE DUE TO the distract AND CONCERN THE weather cause ME.I HAD attempt TO CONTACT phx airport approach BUT THEY WOULD NOT TALK TO ME.I BELIEVE THAT THE weather move IN MUCH fast THAN I HAD anticipate AND MY DECISION TO DEPART WAS influence BY MY DESIRE TO GET HOME BEFORE IT arrive.HOWEVER I FEEL I MADE THE CORRECT DECISION TO ABORT THE flight AND LAND AT THE close airport WHICH WAS FALCON FIELD AS SOON AS I realize THAT I WAS cut IT TOO CLOSE.WHEN I contact phx airport approach I ask FOR DIRECT dvt airport IN ORDER TO AVOID THE thunderstorm BUT THEY say NO TIME FOR visualflightrulestraffic AND TO REMAIN clear OF THE classb AIRSPACE.I THINK THAT UNDER THE circumstance MY CURRENT posit IN relate TO THE weather THE AIRSPACE AND MY altitude THAT I WOULD ONLY HAVE BEEN IN THE classb AIRSPACE FOR AT MOST _ minute AND IF THEY HAD take A MOMENT TO ASSESS MY SIT THAT THEY COULD HAVE help ME OUT.THE phx airport approach FACILITY IS JUST IN THE HABIT OF lock OUT visualflightrulestraffic AND COULD HAVE AT LEAST give ME A squawkcode OR ask ME TO identify IN ORDER TO ASCERTAIN MY posit AND WHAT AFFECT I WOULD actual HAVE ON THEIR AIRSPACE AND traffic.ONCE THEY refuse TO WORK WITH ME I WAS force TO MAKE THE DECISION TO turnaround AND LAND AT FALCON FIELD.I FEAR THAT IN THE PROCESS I CAME extreme CLOSE TO THE classb AIRSPACE THOUGH I DO NOT THINK I actual enter IT IT WAS VERY CLOSE.THE AIRSPACE AROUND phx airport IS VERY COMPLEX ON A SUNNY DAY WHEN weather move IN IT IS sever AND control NEED TO MAKE AN EFFORT TO ASSIST pilot IN THOSE time.
76~I WAS hold SHORT OF runway ON taxiway _.THE control instruct ME TO TAXI ACROSS runway AND contactground control.I acknowledge AND proceed TO crossrunway runway.WHILE ON runway I look left TO FIND A SEMINOLE roll OUT.I WOULD HAVE like TO HAVE know IF THE OTHER aircraft WAS instruct TO HOLD SHORT OF OUR cross taxiway.
77~I WAS IN THE leftseat fly AS captain ALTHOUGH I WAS ON MY _ LEG OF _ DAY REQUALIFICATION initialoperatingexperience.THE check AIRMAN IN THE rightseat WAS fly THAT LEG WE WERE land AT PALOMAR._ GAVE US A descend TO _ feet.I readback THE clearance AND HAD NO correct FROM airtrafficcontrol.WE WERE visualmeteorologicalconditions AND notice THAT WE seem TO BE TOO LOW TO THE TERRAIN AND I WAS ABOUT TO ASK WHAT THE MVA WAS WHEN THE control say WE WERE clear TO _ feet.WE prompt climb TO THE CORRECT altitude.WE DID NOT GET A groundproximitywarningsystemwarning BECAUSE WE WERE IN THE BASE TURN AND THE radaraltimeter DOESN T READ accurate IN turn IT WAS read _ feetabovegroundlevel IN THE TURN.I M NOT SURE WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN DONE differ.WE readback THE clearance AND GOT NO correct.THE MSA IN THAT SECTOR IS _ feet WELL BELOW BOTH altitude SO THAT FIGURE DOESN T THROW A FLAG.WE WERE approximate _ nauticalmile east OF THE ocn airport veryhighfrequencyomnidirectionalradiorange ON THE instrumentlandingsystem FOR runway _ CARLSBAD.
78~THE EVENT occur ON flight X AN instrumentflightrulesflight between SARASOTA AND ORLANDO.THE weather WAS A MIXTURE OF visualmeteorologicalconditions AND instrumentmeteorologicalconditions WITH scatter tower CUMULUS AND THUNDERSHOWERS.trafficpattern altitude approach HAD give US deviate AS NECESSARY TO AVOID THE cell AND TO JOIN THE mine _ arrive north OF THE LAKELAND veryhighfrequencyomnidirectionalradiorange.THE SIT arise WHEN THE autopilot DID NOT CAPTURE THE assignedaltitude OF _ feet.trafficpattern altitude approach assign US _ feet WHICH I THE pilotnotflying enter IN THE altitude preselect.WE WERE climb AT ABOUT _ FPM WHEN WE approach A BANK OF cumuluscloud.IN ORDER TO GET ON TOP OF THESE cloud THE captain utilize A toggleswitch.THIS SWITCH allow THE AIRPLANE TO pitchup _ degree FOR EACH CLICK.YOU CAN PITCH THE aircraft UP fast us THE toggleswitch THAN us THE climb BUTTON ON THE flightdirector THIS increase OUR climb RATE TO AROUND _ FPM AND A PITCH ATTITUDE OF _ degree.AS WE approach _ feet I notice THAT MY altitudearm LIGHT WAS NOT illuminate.I reprogram MY flightdirector AND THE altitudearm LIGHT appear.I DID NOT check THE captain south flightdirector I SHOULD HAVE.WHEN WE reach _ feet THE autopilot DID NOT CAPTURE altitude AND WE continue TO climb.I notice THIS AND click OFF THE autopilot AT _ feet AND start TO manual leveloff THE PLANE.I state IT DIDN T CAPTURE TO THE captain AND HE TOOK THE AIRPLANE.WE DID NOT HAVE A posit EXCHANGE OF control WE SHOULD HAVE.ONCE HE TOOK control OF THE AIRPLANE HE try TO REPROGRAM hi flightdirector AND ENGAGE THE autopilot.WHILE HE WAS try TO DO THIS WE start climb AGAIN DUE TO sever factor.FIRST THE aircraft WAS STILL trim FOR climb flight.second WE WERE VERY LIGHT ON THAT flight AND THE aircraft WAS accelerate quick.COUPLE THIS WITH AN OUT OF TRIM aircraft AND IT STILL want TO climb.THIRD WE WERE OVER SOME cumuluscloud AND WERE get updraft FROM THEM.final BECAUSE WE DID NOT HAVE A posit EXCHANGE OF control THE captain inherit ALL OF THESE condition WHILE try TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WENT WRONG AND FIX THE SIT.I notice THAT WE WERE climb AGAIN AND state climb TO THE captain.AT _ feet HE push OVER AND descend TO _ feet.UPON discuss THE SIT WITH THE captain HE state THAT SOMETIMES WHEN YOU us THE toggleswitch aggressive IT WILL CLICK OFF THE altitudearm MODE OF THE autopilot.I BELIEVE THAT THIS SHOULD BE bring UP IN train AND WHEN THE toggleswitch IS us THE pilot SHOULD recheck THEIR flightdirector TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE STILL arm TO CAPTURE THEIR altitude.
79~IT HAD BEEN _ month SINCE LAST fly THE taildrag _ CESSNA.I HAD BEEN fly A _ regular AND HAD JUST finish A _ hour TRIP FROM _ TALLAHASSEE commerce TO EQY.THE weather WAS beauty AND THE wind WERE LIGHT AND vary TO _ knot FROM _ degree.AS THE runway IS runway _ AT MONROE I decide TO FLY THE _.AFTER preflight AND warmup I TOOK OFF TO STAY IN THE PATTERN TO DO SOME takeoff AND land.I HAD A GOOD FINAL approach ON THE FIRST land SET THE aircraft DOWN HAD A SLIGHT BOUNCE WHILE execute _ POINT land.add SLIGHT power TO ARREST THE BOUNCE SET THE PLANE BACK DOWN.IT WAS STRAIGHT.NO WIND TO SEE ON THE WINDSOCK.THE STICK WAS BACK AND THE PLANE WAS roll OUT NORMAL AND STRAIGHT WHEN I apply THE brake.THE NEXT INSTANT I WAS head TO THE left WITH THE right WING DOWN.THE right TIRE leave BLACK mark ON THE runway AND DESPITE let OFF THE brake AND apply RUDDER TO straight THE aircraft.THE PLANE continue TO THE left IN A CURVING PATH AND RAN OFF THE runway INTO THE GRASS WHERE IT stop face BACK toward THE approach END OF THE runway.I check THE ground light NO hit ON ANYTHING.THE engine WAS run correct THE wing HAD NOT contact THE ground.I THEN taxi BACK TO AN APRON AREA NEAR THE PLANE south NORMAL tiedown SPOT bywayof THE taxiway.I shutdown THE aircraft AND inspect THE tire brake propel wingtip navigate light RUDDER AREA AND TAILWHEEL AREA.I check THE control operate.ALL item WERE FINE.I THEN start THE PLANE taxi OUT AND DID A COMPLETE runup.I TOOK OFF AND MADE _ MORE UNEVENTFUL NORMAL _ POINT land TO FULL STOP.I THEN taxi BACK AND ti DOWN THE aircraft.I CAN ONLY FIGURE THAT I apply DIFFERENTIAL brake THAT start THE lowspeed SWING TO THE left THAT I WAS NOT subsequent ABLE TO control.THE LACK OF consist PRACTICE definite contribute TO this situate.

146~THIS INCIDENT happen BECAUSE OF A GET THE JOB DONE mindset.I want TO MAKE THE aircraft avail TO FLY A schedule MISSION.THE BETTER DECISION WOULD HAVE BEEN TO CANCEL THE flight.IN add A MAJOR contribute FACTOR WAS LACK OF CLARITY OF expect regard THE JOB OF complete THE oilfilter CHANGE.A second FACTOR WAS THAT THE ENTIRE OIL CHANGE WAS NOT complete BY A SINGLE PERSON.pilot advise ME YESTERDAY even THAT HE HAD experience LOSS OF engineoil ON hi flight FROM GNOSS TO IMPERIAL ON FRIDAY morn result IN AN emergency land AT STOCKTON.THE LOSS OF OIL WAS DUE TO THE OIL FILL CAP NOT be install.HERE IS THE HISTORY OF THIS INCIDENT.I schedule AN OIL CHANGE WITH AN fixedbaseoperator FOR THURSDAY morn.I HAD intend TO PERFORM THE CHANGE UNDER THE supervise OF AN A and I be AWAY FROM THE airport FOR A DAY.I TOLD HIM THAT THE cancel WAS A problem SINCE THE aircraft WAS schedule FOR MISSION fly AND THAT I WOULD COME TO THE airport TO workout A SOLUTION.WHEN I arrive WE discuss option.I decide TO PERFORM THE PORTION OF THE OIL CHANGE THAT DID NOT REQUIRE SPECIAL skill OR tool AND TO LEAVE THE remain TO BE complete BY A and I WHEN HE return.I warm THE OIL IN THE runuparea taxiedto THE fixedbaseoperator HANGAR AND perform THE basic remove BOTH cowl HALVES drain THE OIL remove THE OLD FILTER fill THE CRANKCASE WITH NEW OIL loose install THE NEW FILTER AND reinstall THE lowercowling HALF.own agree THAT A and I WOULD TORQUE THE FILTER safetywire IT AND REINSTALL THE UPPER cowl HALF IN TIME FOR AN _ depart ON FRIDAY.I shift MY FOCUS TO install OF THE veryhighfrequencydirectionfinder RADIO WHICH WE HAD receive BACK FROM avionic repair AND WITH THE NEW train emergencylocatortransmitter frequency install.THE reinstall WAS complicate BY SHORT wire.avionic reinstall THE RADIO.I DO NOT RECALL REINSTALLING THE OIL FILL CAP.THE LAST STEP OF THE OIL FILL PROCESS IS remove THE FUNNEL FROM THE FILL PIPE.THE FUNNEL IS OF COURSE OILY AND need TO BE PUT WHERE IT WILL NOT CREATE A MESS.do SO MAY have distract ME.AND SINCE I DID NOT REINSTALL THE UPPER cowl HALF I miss AN OPPORTUNITY TO NOTICE WHETHER OR NOT THE FILL CAP WAS install.
147~AT approximate _ hour ON september _ I WAS enroute FROM GNOSS FIELD DVO MARIN COUNTY TO BUCHANAN FIELD ccr airport visualflightrules ON A businesstrip.I tune TO THE automaticterminalinformationservice OVER THE BAY AT _ feet AND WHILE THE record report WAS INTERMITTENT AND garble I WAS ABLE TO PICK UP runway IN us barometricpressure AND WHAT I THOUGHT WAS _ mile visible THERE WAS NO ceil.I call THE tower AT THE BENICIA BRIDGE WITHIN approximate _ mile FROM airport automaticterminalinformationserviceinformation FOR land.respond FROM THE tower WAS broke AND garble.THE control WAS direct OTHER traffic IN THE AREA ALSO I circle OUTSIDE THE AIRSPACE BUT WAS STILL UNABLE TO GET A REPLY FROM THE tower THAT I COULD DISCERN.NOT IMAGINING FOR A minute THAT THE airport WAS instrumentflightrules BECAUSE I HAD IT IN SIGHT FOR ABOUT _ mile.I visual determine THE FLOW OF traffic AND approach THE airport expect TO GET lightsignal FROM THE tower FOR MY land.I MADE _ MORE ATTEMPT TO CONTACT THE tower AT THIS TIME.AT NO TIME DID I EVER DREAM THE airport WAS instrumentflightrules.IT WAS ONLY AT THIS POINT THAT I WAS AWARE THAT THE visible WAS report TO BE BELOW BASIC instrumentflightrules.ALL radiotransmission BY THE tower AND OTHER aircraft WERE receive broke AND garble.SOME seem block BY OTHER aircraft.I DID NOT KNOW HOW MY radiotransmission WERE be hear.THE tower DID GIVE permit TO LAND AND request I CALL THE tower WHEN park.MY approach TO THE airport AND land WAS visualflightrules.HAD I pick UP ON THE report visible I certain WOULD HAVE request specialvisualflightrules AS MY intent AS I HAVE previous DONE MANY time BEFORE.MY approach WAS INADVERTENT DUE TO radioproblem AND MY flightvisibility OF WELL OVER _ mile require.BEFORE depart FROM CONCORD sameday I check ANTENNA connect BUT MY RADIO WAS STILL SOMEWHAT broke AND garble WITH BOTH ground AND tower AS WELL AS THE automaticterminalinformationservice.
148~ON september _ MY WIFE AND I depart CAMARILLO WITH THE destinate OF BIG BEAR airport fly visualflightrules.WE WERE cruise AT _ feet ABOUT _ mile west OF vny airport airport WHEN THE engine begin shake.power WAS reduce _ approach WAS advise AND bur airport tower clear US TO LAND ON runway _.THE land WAS UNEVENTFUL.IT WAS discover UPON remove THAT THE number _ CYLINDER HAD ingest it EXHAUST VALVE.A YELLOW tag CYLINDER WAS install AT bur airport airport AND THE aircraft WAS fly BACK TO camarilloairport.
149~NEAR THE END OF A longday WE WERE fly A VISUAL approach INTO RENO.THE clearance give WAS YOU reclear THE spark VISUAL TO runway.WE miss THE CALL TO LAND ON runway AND proceed TO LAND ON THE runway WE ALWAYS LAND ON runway.ONLY THE FIRST _ feet WERE OPEN AND WE DID NOT SEE THE barrel UNTIL THE nosegear CAME DOWN.THE automaticterminalinformationservice say THE FIRST _ feet WERE OPEN FOR arrive ON runway BUT NOTHING ABOUT THE runway be close.WE WERE BEHIND AND HAD NOT take adequatetime TO READ ALL THE noticestoairmen FOR RENO.WE HAD fly INTO RENO early THIS MONTH AND THERE WAS NO construct ON runway.ADD THIS TO _ hourday AND BOTH OF US miss IT.THIS problem COULD HAVE BEEN avoid IF I HAD READ THE noticestoairmen.IF THE automaticterminalinformationservice clear state runway WAS UNDER construct AND close PAST LIMA intersect.IF tower HAD notice WE WERE ABOUT TO LAND ON THE wrongrunway.IF tower HAD confirm land ON runway ON MY READBACK.IF INSTEAD OF get THE spark VISUAL TO runway WE WERE give AN initialclearance TO LAND ON runway.IF WE WERE NOT rush between FLTS.IF WE HAD question THE VAGUE automaticterminalinformationservice OF THE FIRST _ feet OF runway ARE avail FOR ARRS ONLY.supplementalinformation FROM airborneclassificationnumber _ telephone THE tower ON THE ground THEY say THEY WOULD EXAMINE THE tape.WHEN I call BACK THEY TOLD ME THAT I WAS clear FOR spark VISUAL approach TO runway BUT tower clear ME TO landrunway.WE land ON A runway THAT WE WERE NOT clear TO LAND ON.THERE WAS NO separate problem OR CONFLICT OTHER THAN THE construct safetyzone AREA FURTHER DOWN THE runway AND THIS WAS THE REASON FOR THE clearance TO LAND ON THE left runway.HAD I NOT rush I WOULD HAVE note ELSEWHERE THE construct note ON A PORTION OF runway.THIS WOULD HAVE caution ME TO BE headsup FOR runway.THE control SHOULD HAVE say spark VISUAL runway.NO REASON TO EVEN MENTION THE right runway.ON switch TO tower WE WERE clear TO LAND.THE towerpersonnel say WE WERE TO landrunway BUT WE DID NOT HEAR THIS probable BECAUSE WE WERE SET TO LAND ON runway.runway IS NOT NORMAL aircraft land runway.AND SINCE THIS WAS A fair RECENT CHANGE THE control SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE EMPHATIC IN hi clearance OR ALERT TO OUR respond TO THE clearance.THIS IS NOT mean TO IMPART BLAME BUT IT SURE WOULD HAVE BEEN help TO US IN this situate.
150~DUE TO RADIO blindspot AT abq airport I HAD MUCH difficult IN obtain A departureclearance.I obtain A taxiclearance WITH on RADIO WHILE try TO OBTAIN A departureclearance WITH THE OTHER.WHILE taxi THE rout I usual RECEIVE I WAS TOLD I WAS taxi ON A rout OTHER THAN clear.I THEN follow THEIR instruct TO THE depart runway.I ALSO final receive MY departureclearance ONCE I WAS OUT OF on OF THE blindspot.try TO DO _ thing AT ONCE WITH _ set OF radio AND RADIO blindspot AT abq airport WAS A majorfactor.
151~OUR flightcrew WAS schedule TO FLY A CHARTER FROM dov airport TO clt airport.THE origin departuretime WAS push BACK DUE TO minimumrest requirement FOR THE flightcrew.WE THE flightcrew arrive TO BASE operate approximate _.THE captain AND firstofficer THEN begin TO REVIEW THE depart paper.I copy DOWN THE NECESSARY inform FOR ME TO COMPLETE MY perform calculate AS WELL AS fuelload DATA.WITH THIS I THEN proceed OUT TO THE RAMP TO PERFORM MY preflight inspect.DUE TO UNFORESEEN circumstance FROM OUR arrive early THAT DAY WE WERE UNABLE TO us CERTAIN fueltruck ON OUR aircraft SO IT HAD BEEN arrange THAT A CONTRACT VENDOR WOULD BE avail FOR fuel.AS I approach THE aircraft THE FUELER appear TO HAVE BEEN ALREADY hook UP TO THE aircraft await A FUEL ORDER.I prompt GAVE HIM THE FUEL ORDER.I THEN begin TO PERFORM MY EXTERIOR safe inspect.DURING THIS inspect I encounter THE PERSON IN CHARGE ON THE RAMP NEAR THE aircraft.I ask HER HOW LONG SHE HAD BEEN wait AND SHE say THAT THEY HAD BEEN wait approximate _ hour.I THEN notice THAT THERE WERE PEOPLE stand IN THE maincabindoor ENTRY.I proceed UP THE stair AND INTO THE COCKPIT TO ASSURE externalpower WAS avail TO BEGIN THE fuel PROCESS.AS I RECALL THE externalpower WAS connect TO THE aircraft AND I BELIEVE AT THAT TIME I MAY HAVE switch THE SHIP south power TO EXTERNAL IF IT HAD NOT ALREADY BEEN DONE.I THEN continue MY converse WITH THE SPOKESPERSON ABOUT THE passenger.SHE inform ME THAT A dispatch flight control GAVE HER THE permit TO BOARD THE aircraft WITHOUT THE flightcrew OR flightattendant onboard.MEANWHILE THE FUELER HAS ALREADY begin THE fuel PROCESS.I evaluate THE SIT AND initial THOUGHT THAT fuel THE aircraft WITH passenger onboard WITH NO flightattendant WAS accept AS LONG AS THE maincabindoor WAS OPEN AND A crewmember WAS ABOARD.AFTER refer MY operate MANUAL I realize THE PREVIOUS STATEMENT WAS INCORRECT.BEFORE I WAS ABLE TO ALTER THE SIT THE fuel PROCESS WAS COMPLETE.THE FUELER CAME ABOARD AND request PAYMENT.I inform HIM THAT THE captain HAD THE COMPANY CREDIT CARD AND WAS IN BASE operate.NOW I WAS STUCK WITH A PLANE FULL OF delay passenger full fuel AND NO WAY TO CONTACT THE captain AT BASE operate.THE auxiliarypowerunit WAS start IN ORDER TO GIVE THE passenger aircondition AND VENTILATION.AFTER FURTHER inspect OF THE BACK OF THE aircraft I realize THE passenger elect TO FEED THEMSELVES FROM THE cater cart IN THE GALLEY.EMPTY FOOD box AND LITTER WERE throw ABOUT THE CABIN.THE captain AND firstofficer arrive LATER.ONCE THE captain realize THE passenger WERE board HE proceed BACK TO BASE operate TO CONTACT COMPANY.THE firstofficer AND MYSELF elect TO STAY WITH THE aircraft.IT WAS LATER decide THAT THE passenger WOULD DEPLANE THE aircraft SO THE flightattendant WOULD BE ABLE TO PERFORM THEIR require safe check.UPON complete THE flight depart WITHOUT FURTHER INCIDENT.I BELIEVE THAT sever factor contribute TO THIS EVENT priorapproval FROM COMPANY TO ALLOW THE board TO BEGIN WITHOUT qualify crewmember PRESENT.MISCONCEPTION OF THE legal OF fuel THE aircraft WITH passenger ABOARD AND NO qualify crewmember ABOARD.

182~WHILE approach ORD FROM THE east WE WERE vector TO THE airport FOR A VISUAL approach TO runway.THE locate COURSE OF _ degree WAS SET BY THE firstofficer ON THE captain south horizontalsituationindicator.THE locate frequency WAS tune IN THE STANDBY posit AND THE veryhighfrequencyomnidirectionalradiorange ORD WAS tune IN THE ACTIVE posit.THE captain WAS NOT AWARE THE veryhighfrequencyomnidirectionalradiorange AND NOT THE locate WAS tune.THE aircraft WAS nave TO runway bywayof THE veryhighfrequencyomnidirectionalradiorange COURSE INSTEAD OF THE locate COURSE.WHILE ON BASE TO FINAL approach A _ WAS see ON OUR trafficalertandcollisionavoidancesystem _ AND visual AND OUR TURN RATE WAS increase SO AS TO AVOID THAT aircraft WHICH WAS land ON runway.OUR trafficalertandcollisionavoidancesystem _ GAVE US A trafficadvisory AND AN resolutionadvisory TO AVOID THE _.THE mislocate OF OUR aircraft WAS discover BY THE visualsighting OF THE _ ON FINAL FOR runway.THE problem COULD HAVE BEEN avoid IN sever way _ THE firstofficer SHOULD HAVE tune ALL radio pertain TO THE approach._ THE captain SHOULD VERIFY WHAT radio ARE tune AND WHICH ARE NOT tune.TOO MANY assumption WERE MADE WITHOUT verify._ VISUAL approach TO BUSY airport SHOULD NOT utilize.I THINK CREW inaction cause this situate TO DEVELOP IE aircraft be between BOTH parallelrunway.BOTH pilot IN THE misplace aircraft THOUGHT THE OTHER pilot WAS AWARE OF THE navigate AND RADIO setup.
183~I WAS work groundcontrol THERE WAS train ON local control.I ask local control FOR approve TO crossrunway runway AT taxiway G TO taxiway H.local control approve THE runwaycrossing BEHIND A depart _.WHEN THE _ pass I instruct THE CESSNA CARAVAN TO crossrunway runway FROM taxiway G TO taxiway H.AS THE CARAVAN turn ONTO THE runway THE train clear AN aircraft _ FOR takeoff ON runway.I TOLD THE train THERE WAS STILL AN aircraft ON runway.THE train say SOMETHING LIKE OH SORRY BUT TOOK NO correctiveaction.final THE train decide TO TAKE ACTION AND cancel THE aircraft south takeoffclearance.this situate COULD easy HAVE BEEN avoid IF THE train OR train HAD scan THE runway BEFORE issue THE takeoffclearance.THE supervise IN THE towercabin MADE NO investigate AND appear NOT TO HAVE DONE ANYTHING ABOUT THE INCIDENT.THIS supervise appear TO BE cover UP ALL SUCH occur.THE INCIDENT WAS write UP IN THE train FORM.
184~FULL FACE SMOKE goggle ON oxygenmask MAKE primaryflightdisplay AND OTHER instrument HARD TO SEE ON PANEL special WITH brightsun shine IN COCKPIT.I THE captain WENT TO THE BATHROOM SO firstofficer don oxygenmask PER procedure.THE difficult create BY have THE oxygenmask ON WITH INTEGRAL goggle THAT MADE THE PANEL HARD TO SEE near cause US TO MISS A cross restrict OF _ mile south OF OTT AT flightlevel.THE COMPANY MIGHT CONSIDER go TO AN oxygenmask WITH SEPARATE goggle LIKE THE _ HAS._ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ IT HAS BEEN THE observe OF THE report pilot THAT THE occur OF THIS oxygenmask GOGGLE FILM appear TO BE ON THE new aircraft.IT appear THE FILM IS TO PROTECT THE LENS BUT obscure VISION IN CERTAIN lightingcondition.THE report question WHETHER THE FILM WAS intend FOR us OR TO HAVE protect THE LENS DURING MANUFACTURE AND ship process.
185~I WAS work THE cabincoordinator posit.THERE WAS train ON local control posit.THE traffic WAS LIGHT TO MODERATE.THE train taxi A businessjet INTO posit ON runway BEHIND A land aircraftjet.THERE WAS AN aircraft _ ON _ _ mile FINAL show A _ knot airspeed.I inform THE train THIS WOULD NOT WORK.THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH SPACE between THE _ land aircraft.THE train say THAT IT WAS OK THE train need SOME PRACTICE send AN aircraft AROUND.THIS bring OVER THE supervise TO WATCH THE operate.THE supervise STOOD AT THE WINDOW stare AT THE aircraft involve.THE land JET turn right AT taxiway J.AT THIS TIME THE _ WAS ON _ _ mile FINAL.THE train clear THE businessjet FOR takeoff.THE businessjet WAS ABOUT _ feet pass taxiway C WHEN THE _ WAS OVER THE displace THRESHOLD.THE train AT THIS TIME TOLD THE train TO SEND THE _ AROUND.THE train appear TO BE MESMERIZED AND DID NOTHING.WHEN THE _ WAS PAST taxiway C THE businessjet WAS JUST PAST THE control tower NOT PAST taxiway H.THERE WAS LESS THAN _ feet separate.THE _ _ samerunwayseparation IS _ feet.THE train say TO ME afterward THAT HE HAD READ ALL THE PREVIOUS train report AND THEY ALL say THE train WAS READY FOR checkout THAT IS WHY HE TOOK NO FURTHER correctiveaction.THE supervise watch THE INCIDENT AND HAS DONE NOTHING SINCE.HE appear TO BE cover UP THIS LOSS OF separate.THERE WAS NO investigate._ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report state THAT NO operatorerror WAS report AS A RESULT OF THE INCIDENT WITH businessjet take OFF AND AN aircraft aircraft land CLOSE BEHIND ON THE samerunway.IN A discuss WITH THE instruct LATER ABOUT THE INCIDENT HE WAS TOLD THAT A REVIEW OF THE train south train report indicate THAT A checkout WAS recommend AND HE want TO SEE WHAT THE train COULD DO.ON A QUESTION ABOUT instructor THE report say ALL OF THE FPL south AT THE FACILITY CAN INSTRUCT AND MOST HAVE HAD SOME instruct train.
186~WHILE ON FINAL approach INTO sjc airport flap _ degree WAS select.I notice WHILE go PAST flap _ degree THE aircraft equip MORE AND MORE right AILERON TO KEEP wing LEVEL UP TO _ degree.powersetting WAS note EQUAL WIND WAS NO FACTOR FLAP indicate show NO SPLIT FLAP AND OVERHEAD FLAP indicate show NORMAL indicate.WHILE check problem aircraft drift TO runwaycenterline.firstofficer note lineup problem AND THEN tower SO I correct BACK TO runwaycenterline AND land WITHOUT INCIDENT.THE aircraft WAS fly _ LEG early santx to phx airport BY THE firstofficer.WHEN land IN phx airport THE WIND WAS high vary WITH DUST storm IN THE outlie AREA SO IT WAS HARD TO DETERMINE IF THE problem exist ON THE previousflight._ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ THE report state THAT THERE WERE NO indication ON THE flightdeck OF A SPLIT FLAP CONDITION.HE follow THE STATUS OF THE aircraft AND FOUND OUT THAT THE nextday DURING A ferryflight _ maintain technician WERE onboard.AS THE flap WERE extend EACH TECHNICIAN monitor THE flap FROM INSIDE THE aircraft.THOUGH NO SPLIT FLAP indication WERE note ON THE flightdeck on OF THE flap keep come UP.THE report state THAT THE aircraft WAS DOWN FOR maintain FOR _ OR MORE day.THIS WAS hi firstexperience WITH A SPLIT FLAP problem ON A _.
187~WE WERE issue A descentclearance TO flightlevel _ nauticalmile northeast OF heavymaintenancevisit veryhighfrequencyomnidirectionalradiorange CRUISE altitude flightlevel.A WAYPOINT _ nauticalmile northeast OF heavymaintenancevisit WAS PUT IN FOR EXTRA ERROR MARGIN BUT I inadvertent PUT THE altitude NEXT TO heavymaintenancevisit veryhighfrequencyomnidirectionalradiorange AFTER amend THE flightmanagementsystem rout WITH THE NEW WAYPOINT.BOTH OF US WERE involve IN enter THE DATA I type captain watch BUT WE BOTH miss THE ERROR.short AFTER airtrafficcontrol ask IF WE WERE ABOUT TO BEGIN THE descend.WE realize THE program ERROR AND start DOWN.THE _ nauticalmile FIX WAS cross AT flightlevel level AT flightlevel BY _ mile PAST FIX.
188~WE WERE approach dtw airport AT _ feet ON THE POLAR _ arrive approximate _ mile FROM dtw airport veryhighfrequencyomnidirectionalradiorange WHEN I notice A TARGET ON THE trafficalertandcollisionavoidancesystem _.THE TARGET show _ feet BELOW OUR altitude LEVEL AT OUR _ o'clock posit AND _ mile AND appear TO BE close WITH US.I HAD THE copilot QUERY dtw airport approachcontrol ABOUT THE traffic WHILE WE BOTH try TO ACQUIRE HIM visual.BEFORE approachcontrol COULD ANSWER WE receive AN resolutionadvisory tell US TO climb climb WHICH I respond TO WHILE THE copilot advise approach THAT WE WERE climb IN respond TO AN resolutionadvisory.I climb approximate _ feet WHEN THE resolutionadvisory advise MONITOR verticalspeed SO I level AT _ feet AND GOT THE clear OF CONFLICT I descend BACK TO _ feet.I ask approach IF HE WAS AWARE OF THIS traffic AND HE say HE WAS be handle BY FLINT mile approach AND WAS visualflightrules maintain visualseparation FROM US AT _ feet.I say THAT I DIDN T FEEL _ feet WAS ADEQUATE visualseparation AND HE show UP AS be AT _ feet ON MY trafficalertandcollisionavoidancesystem _.HE say WELL HE south visualflightrules.WE acquire THE TARGET visual AND HE WAS A DARK BLUE BIPLANE.WE SAW HIM AS WE begin THE resolutionadvisory MANEUVER.I WAS VERY GLAD TO HAVE HAD trafficalertandcollisionavoidancesystem _ onboard OR WE WOULD HAVE COME VERY CLOSE TO THIS aircraft assume WE DID NOT SEE IT FIRST.THIS MAINTAIN visualseparation SHORTCUT IS IN MY OPINION A DETRIMENT TO airsafety.I WAS NEVER TOLD AS I AM AWARE I AM NOT require TO BE TOLD THAT I HAD AN aircraft maintain visualseparation FROM ME.I BELIEVE THAT BOTH aircraft SHOULD BE notify OF A MAINTAIN visualseparation clearance OR IT SHOULD NOT BE us.IT IS special danger IN THE ase airport OF A SMALL HARD TO SEE lightairplane pilot BY AN inexperiencedpilot TOLD TO MAINTAIN visualseparation FROM AN airline EASY TO SEE HARD TO getaway FROM.THE smallaircraft CAN easy SEE THE airline BUT THE difficult come WITH judge speed AND closurerate MOST weekend private pilot DON T HAVE ADEQUATE train TO safe DO THAT.THE problem come WHEN control SUCKER pilot INTO A MAINTAIN visualseparation SIT.THE EXCHANGE go SOMETHING LIKE THIS control CESSNA _ DO YOU HAVE THE _ IN SIGHT _ o'clock AND _ mile.CESSNA affirm WE HAVE HIM IN SIGHT.control CESSNA _ MAINTAIN visualseparation FROM THE _.DO YOU SEE THE problem.NOBODY HAS EVEN talk TO THE _ AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THE ONUS IS ON THE GUY IN THE CESSNA WHO COULD BE A BRAND NEW privatepilot.KIND OF A flaw system DON T YOU AGREE.
189~follow AN enginefailure ON takeoff I level THE aircraft AT _ feetmeansealevel _ feetabovegroundlevel DUE TO VERY limit aircraftperformance.I WAS ABLE TO climb THE aircraft TO _ feetmeansealevel FLOOR OF atl airport classcairspace AFTER turn DOWNWIND.I declare AN emergency AND return TO atl airport.THERE WERE NO report conflict.
190~THE flight start OUT normal THE STUDENT DID THE preflight AND EVERYTHING check OUT OK.WE THEN LISTEN TO THE automaticterminalinformationservice AND receive taxiinstruction TO THE activerunway _.WHILE WE complete THE BEFORE takeoffchecklist THE WIND change direct.tower direct US TO us THE runway TO TAXI TO THE OTHER END FOR takeoffrunway _.I taxi DOWN TO THE OTHER END AND TOOK OFF.I NEVER contact THEM AGAIN BEFORE I TOOK OFF.NO OTHER airplane WERE IN THE VICINITY.THE STUDENT IS A NEW STUDENT THAT ALWAYS HAS A LOT OF question.on QUESTION ALWAYS lead TO ANOTHER SO THERE CAN BE SOME fair LONG discuss ON A largenumber OF subject.WHILE WE WERE taxi ON THE runway SHE start TO ASK ME A NUMBER OF question UNRELATED TO THE ACTUAL takeoff.BY THE TIME WE reach THE OTHER runway AND GOT setup FOR takeoff I WAS SO remove FROM THE SIT THAT I DID NOT CONTACT THE tower.HOWEVER I DID PERFORM THE lineup checklist light ON transpond ON.I realize THIS AT ABOUT _ feet ABOVE THE runway.I talk TO THE tower ON THE RADIO AND IT DID NOT SEEM LIKE THEY EVEN notice.NOTHING WAS EVER say ABOUT IT.BEFORE OUR nextflight I sit DOWN WITH THE STUDENT AND WE HAD A discuss ABOUT WHAT happen AND HOW TO AVOID IT IN THE FUTURE.WE decide THAT A sterilecockpit WAS go TO BE NECESSARY WHILE ON THE ground IN THE classdairspace AND BELOW _ feetabovegroundlevel.ONLY question relate TO THAT PHASE OF flight WOULD BE allow.SHE WILL NOW HAVE A notepad TO WRITE DOWN question TO BE answer LATER.I AM NOW MORE vigil WHILE ON THE ground AND I WAIT UNTIL clearance TO receive BEFORE perform THE lineup checklist TO PREVENT THIS FROM happen AGAIN.
191~taxiinstruction WERE issue TO TAXI runway _ HOLD SHORT taxiway east.captain begin TO TAXI WHILE I perform taxichecklist item.THE captain speak ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE AND I DON T THINK HE hear HOLD SHORT.I look UP IN TIME TO TELL HIM TO STOP AS WE WERE ABEAM taxiway east.HE THEN instruct ME TO INFORM tower THAT WE WERE READY FOR depart.HE THEN TOLD US TO TAXI UP TO HOLD SHORT OF THE runway.HE start taxi TO THE HOLD SHORT LINE AND round THE CORNER ONTO TAXI east WHICH IS A taxiway THAT IS line UP WITH THE centerline OF runway _ BUT WELL SHORT OF THE land THRESHOLD.AS ANOTHER aircraft WAS IN closedtraffic I BELIEVE THE confuse taxiwaymarking combine WITH THE captain south ENGLISH deficiency contribute TO THE SIT IN add TO confuse second taxiinstruction.THE aircraft IN closedtraffic PATTERN keep A safealtitude AND fly overtop OF OUR aircraft TO A SAFE UNEVENTFUL land.tower request NO SPECIAL action FROM EITHER aircraft OR inform FROM THE pilot.
192~I WAS fly IN THE rightseat OF THE CHEROKEE WARRIOR AS I continue A SERIES OF touch and go.THERE WAS NO on ELSE IN THE aircraft.AS I depart ccr airport south runway AFTER do A touch and go I BELIEVE MY aircraft CAME WITHIN _ feet horizontal AND _ feet vertical OF A SCHWEITZER train heliport depart on OF THE _ land pad ON taxiway A travel IN rough THE samedirection AS I WAS AT ABOUT _ feetmeansealevel.IN THE second THAT precede THIS ENCOUNTER THE localcontroller clear _ helicopter TO takeoff FROM pad _ AND _.THE FIRST MADE A right crosswinddeparture ABOUT _ feet IN FRONT OF ME AS I BECAME AIRBORNE HE cross runway FROM left TO right AT ABOUT _ feetmeansealevel AND I alter COURSE slight LESS THAN _ degree TO THE left TO AVOID.ALTHOUGH THE ENCOUNTER WAS close THAN I WOULD HAVE like I DO NOT THINK A collide WOULD HAVE result IF I HAD NOT turn AT THIS TIME THE control advise ME OF _ helicopter AND I acknowledge THAT I HAD A heliport IN SIGHT DUE TO MY posit IN THE AIRPLANE AND MY ANGLE OF climb I NEVER SAW THE SECOND heliport UNTIL I SAW it rotor slight UNDERNEATH MY left WING AND pass BEHIND ME WHICH occur JUST AS I finish MY transmit.runway AND taxiway A ARE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER AND this situate WAS FURTHER aggravate BY MY SLIGHT TURN TOWARD taxiwayalpha TO AVOID encounter traffic AHEAD AND slight TO MY right WHICH I WOULD NOT HAVE DONE IF I WAS AWARE OF THE SECOND heliport TO MY left.runway WAS ALSO IN us BUT I DO NOT THINK ani aircraft WERE us IT AT THAT MOMENT.I THINK IT IS POSSIBLE FOR airplane TO us runway and right WHILE THERE IS heliport ACTIVITY ON taxiway A BUT AT NO TIME SHOULD helicopter AND airplane BE fly SIMULTANEOUS departure IT IS JUST TOO CLOSE.THE wind WERE LIGHT AND vary AT THE TIME THERE IS NO REASON WHY fix WING aircraft COULDN T HAVE BEEN us runway and right INSTEAD._ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ THE report state THAT HE HAD NEVER experience THIS KIND OF problem BEFORE AT ccr airport.hi impress IS THAT ccr airport tower doe NOT HAVE AN standardoperatingprocedure allow SIMULTANEOUS takeoff FOR fix WING aircraft AND helicopter AND THAT hi WAS probable AN isolate INCIDENT.HE state THAT THERE WAS NO discuss BY THE heliport pilot OVER THE AIR THAT EITHER OF THEM HAD COME IN CLOSE proximity TO A fix WING aircraft.THE tower say NOTHING regard THE INCIDENT.
193~I WAS THE pilotflying THE firstofficer.WE HAD DONE sever leg OUT OF SACRAMENTO ALREADY THAT DAY AND ARE usual assign _ feet.BECAUSE OF _ traffic ABOVE US WE WERE assign _ feet INSTEAD UPON depart WITH SACRAMENTO approach.WE BOTH acknowledge THE altitude AND SAW THE traffic IN QUESTION ABOVE US AND ON THE trafficalertandcollisionavoidancesystem _.WE DID OUR STANDARD altitude call OF _ feet AND _ feet TO GO.WE WERE IN THE MIDST OF discuss THE FACT THAT THE traffic WE visual SAW seem TO BE FARTHER AWAY THAN WHAT THE trafficalertandcollisionavoidancesystem _ WAS say AND WE WERE try TO CONFIRM WITH EACH OTHER THAT THE traffic WE SAW WAS IN FACT THE traffic THE control WAS try TO KEEP US AWAY FROM.WE confirm THAT IT WAS THE traffic AND I look DOWN TO DISCOVER THAT I HAD GONE climb THROUGH THE assignedaltitude OF _ feet BY _ feet.I quick descend BACK TO _ feet BUT BY THAT TIME THE control GAVE US _ feet AND WE climb TO THAT.THIS happen ON THE _ LEG OF _ legday WHERE WE INCUR A LOT OF redundant WITH trip.THE point WHICH contribute TO THIS EVENT occur I BELIEVE WERE _ MINOR pilotfatigue._ redundant AND familiar._ distract AND emphasize ON traffic.
194~A MASSIVE thunderstorm system WAS impact THE ENTIRE MIDWEST FROM NEAR CANADA south THROUGH TEXAS.on HOLE IN STORM east OF MCK.ALMOST ALL _ aircraft WERE funnel toward THIS HOLE.A COMPLETE systemfailure WAS UNDERWAY.EVERY SECTOR IN OUR AREA WAS saturate WITH plane.EVERY control work AT THE TIME IN OUR AREA WAS plug IN.NUMEROUS OTHER control WERE summon FROM OTHER area TO HELP WITH STRIP deliver.NUMEROUS manage PERSONNEL WERE IN THE AREA AS wit TO WHAT WAS happen.THIS IN ITSELF WAS danger BUT FAR WORSE WAS happen.THERE WERE numerousaircraft deviate occur.IE intruderaircraft plane fly THROUGH OUR AIRSPACE UNTRACKED uncontrolled AND WE WERE UNABLE TO identify THEM.WHY.BECAUSE center to center computer ARE NOT full INTERFACED.WHY.cost TOO MUCH.WE ALMOST HAD MIDAIR collision THAT NIGHT.IF WE DID THE federalaviationadministration WOULD SPEND THE MONEY TO INTERFACE THESE computer.THANK GOD WE DIDN T.this situate CAN AND WILL HAPPEN AGAIN.current OUR COMPUTER display limiteddata block IN OTHER center show US beaconcode AND altitude.BUT WE CANNOT ACCESS THE flightdata WE NEED.WHY.THE computer ARE NOT proper INTERFACED._ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report state THE NIGHT IN QUESTION require SERIOUS aircraft weatherdeviation.THE report south CONCERN IS THAT flight PLAN process OF aircraft NOT destine TO TRANSIT ZDV south AIRSPACE DO NOT PROVIDE OR MAKE avail ani flight rout DATA TO ZDV FOR THAT aircraft.A limiteddatablock IS display WITH altitude AS AN INTRUDER datatag.THE report state THAT HE feel THAT ani aircraft fly IN THE airtrafficcontrol nationalairspacesystem system SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE access BY ani control.THE control state THAT THIS TYPE OF flightdata ACCESS process IS ALREADY avail AT THE traffic manage posit BUT NOT FOR THE control.THE NIGHT OF CONCERN traffic deviate FROM ZKC INTO ZMP receive APPROPRIATE coordinate.BUT WHEN aircraft deviate OUT OF ZMP INTO ZDV DUE TO weather THEN BACK INTO ZKC ZDV receive ONLY SOME OF THE require point out.
195~ON october _ AT _ aircraft notify ME OF A ceil PANEL I HAD reinstall HAD fall DOWN _ day LATER AND THE federalaviationadministration HAS SENT A NOTICE OF investigate TO aircraft question THE maintain perform ON THE aircraft.THE PANEL I reinstall IS JUST AFT OF THE cockpitdoor WITH _ BAYONET fasten secure THE PANEL SEE illustratedpartscatalog refer _ WHICH IS enclose.THE maintain I perform WAS PER aircraft maintain procedure ALL _ bayonet WERE SECURE IN PANEL AND NO TAPE WAS us ON THIS PANEL.
196~WE WERE ON A shortflight AT _ feet.THERE WAS weather IN THE AREA AND MOST FLTS WERE EITHER deviate OR ON vector AROUND IT.airtrafficcontrol WAS VERY BUSY.WE WERE TOLD TO climb TO MAINTAIN on SEVEN thousandfeet AND give AN altimetersetting.I repeat THE clearanceback AS THE captain AND I BOTH hear IT.MY captain initiate A _ FPM climb us THE autopilot.short THEREAFTER airtrafficcontrol TOLD US THEY WERE show US IN A climb WHICH WE WERE.I THEN TOLD THE control THAT SHE HAD clear US TO _ feet AND THAT I HAD READ IT BACK.THE control TOLD US THAT THE clearance WAS NOT TO _ feet BUT TO MAINTAIN on SEVEN ZERO knot.WE slow THE aircraft AND WERE THEN give A VECTOR TO RESEQUENCE.AT NO TIME WERE WE IN CONFLICT WITH OTHER traffic IE NO trafficadvisory south OR resolutionadvisory south FROM trafficalertandcollisionavoidancesystem _.IF INDEED WE WERE TOLD _ knot AND NOT _ feet THEN WHY THE altimetersetting.THAT IS SOMETHING WE ARE us TO associate WITH A CHANGE IN altitude OR A handoff.correctiveaction COULD BE TO PREFACE A speed assign us THE WORD speed AS IN REDUCE speed MAINTAIN _ knot AND NOT JUST MAINTAIN _ knot.IT south VERY EASY FOR THESE thing TO TAKE PLACE WHEN thing GET BUSY.HOWEVER THAT IS THE REASON FOR THE READBACK.listen IS THE KEY TO communicate.
197~I HAD JUST land AT SAF AND WAS taxi IN THE ramparea TO PICK UP A passenger.I notice AN aircraft near approximate _ yard AWAY THAT WAS load passenger BUT DID NOT THINK TWICE ABOUT IT.short THEREAFTER I WAS inform BY THE tower THAT I WAS IN A SECURITY AREA AND WOULD BE fine UNLESS I vacate IT immediate.I look close AT THE ramparea AND notice I WAS evident ON THE wrongside OF A redline.I taxi OUT OF THE AREA immediate.evident THE redline DELINEATES A SECURITY AREA WHICH IS ACTIVE WHEN passenger ARE load OR unload IN IT FROM commuterairline.DESPITE do MUCH OF MY studenttraining AT SAF I WAS NEVER brief ON THIS.I ask sever local pilot AND instructor IF THEY WERE AWARE OF THE exist OF A SECURITY AREA AT SAF.NONE WERE.I COULD ALSO FIND NO MENTION OF IT IN THE AIM OR airportfacilitydirectory.THE us OF A SECURITY AREA FOR commerce passenger make PERFECT SENSE AND NOW THAT I AM AWARE OF IT I WILL AVOID IT IN THE FUTURE.HOWEVER IT WOULD BE MORE effect IF it exist PURPOSE WERE publish TO local pilot.
198~flightcrew note FAINT FUEL SMELL.SMELL trace TO A BOX IN forwardcargo.airtrafficcontrol SOC notify AND CFR call.emergency land AT txk airport.passenger remove quick.NO injury DAMAGE OR SPILLAGE OF hazardousmaterial.CFR inform US THE BOX contain A chainsaw WITH A smallamount OF FUEL IN it TANK.
199~depart clt airport firstofficer LEG WE expect TO DEPART runway.runway DATA WAS print FOR runway WE brief THE PANTHER _ depart us runway.WHEN WE push OFF OF THE GATE WE WERE inform WE WOULD BE depart runway.THERE WAS NOT MUCH ground traffic SO THE TAXI WAS SHORT.WE DIDN T HAVE radiocontact WITH OUR STATION PEOPLE IN clt airport SO I HAD TO REPROGRAM THE flightmanagementcomputer AND FIGURE OUT NEW takeoffdata FOR runway.I fail TO rebrief THE depart AND STILL HAD THE MODE control setup FOR A TURN TO _ degree FOR runway INSTEAD OF _ degree FOR runway.I depart runway turn TO A head OF _ degree.WHEN THE captain contact depart HE inform US OUR head SHOULD BE _ degree.WE turn right AND HE GAVE US A head TO INTERCEPT THE _ degree RADIAL TO MERIL intersect.THE _ WITH it automate UPLINK FEATURE CAN BE frustrate IN SITS LIKE THIS BECAUSE WHEN YOU RECEIVE A CHANGE ON TAXI IT take A WHILE TO REPROGRAM EVERYTHING.NO communicate WITH THE STATION WOULD HAVE take SOME OF THE WORKLOAD OFF OF THE cockpitcrew BUT THEY WERE IN THE PROCESS OF get A NEW RADIO install.THE CHAIN OF event start WITH THE depart NOT be rebrief.I AM begin TO THINK THE automate flightmanagementsystem automate UPDATE CAN BE MORE OF A problem THAN it WORTH.AS WE ALL KNOW IT WAS THE CLASSIC CHAIN OF event THAT normal DON T HAPPEN THAT cause A high cockpitworkload THAN NORMAL.
200~I WAS secondincommand BUT pilotflying IN THE leftseat.THE captain file instrumentflightrules FROM ST THOMAS ONTARIO CANADA CYQS TO teb airport.HE file THE PENNS on arrive OVER LVZ.HOWEVER WE WERE clear THE _ _ arrive.HE DID NOT BRIEF ME ON THIS NOR DID I INQUIRE.THE captain load THE flight PLAN INTO THE flightmanagementsystem THOUGH WITH THE PENNS on arrive AND DID NOT CHANGE IT TO THE _ _ arrive.WHEN WE WERE OVER LVZ veryhighfrequencyomnidirectionalradiorange THE captain NOT fly IN THE rightseat WAS ON THE OTHER communicate RADIO get automaticterminalinformationserviceinformation.I WAS cover THE frequency WITH center.WE WERE AT flightlevel AND give A clearance TO CROSS MUGZY intersect AT _ feet.I start MY descend OUT OF flightlevel plan TO PROGRAM THE flightmanagementsystem FOR A vertical descend FOR MUGZY intersect.AT THE sametime THE captain WAS return TO THE ACTIVE RADIO I discover THAT MUGZY WAS NOT A POINT load IN THE flightmanagementsystem flight PLAN.I TOLD THE captain WE WERE clear TO CROSS MUGZY AT _ feet.HE GOT ON THE RADIO TO STATE THAT MUGZY WAS NOT ON OUR rout.airtrafficcontrol say THAT MUGZY WAS ON THE _ _ arrive AND CROSS MUGZY AT _ feet.AFTER SOME confuse second WE realize WE WERE look AT THE PENNS on arrivalchart HAD PENNS on load IN THE flightmanagementsystem AND WERE fly THE WRONG rout.airtrafficcontrol TOLD US TO climb BACK TO flightlevel AND TURN left TO _ degree head.WE WERE NOT TOLD OF ani conflictingtraffic.lesson learn parttime pilot NOT PROFICIENT IN aircraft draw A LOT OF THE OTHER pilot south attention.THIS lead TO A breakdown IN CREW coordinate TO crosscheck clearance ETC.supplementalinformation FROM airborneclassificationnumber _ contribute factor _ THE pilotflying WAS A TEMPORARY fill in pilot WHO HASN T fly AN _ IN _ month AND WAS ALSO NEW TO THIS TYPE OF flightmanagementsystem.THIS interrupt THE NORMAL CREW FEEDBACK LOOP._ THE pilotflying accept THE INITIAL arrive descentclearance WHILE I WAS ON THE OTHER RADIO get A clearance._ THE standardterminalarrivalroute THAT WE WERE fly WAS THE on THAT I file.IT NEVER GOT change IN THE flightmanagementsystem south._ star origin AT THE SAME FIX.
201~captain point TO powerport wire BELOW COACH seat AND say HE HAD wit arc between SAME wire AND SEAT FRAME ON ANOTHER PLANE.HE want TO KNOW WHAT system IT WAS AND WHERE TO TURN IT OFF inflight.UPON FURTHER investigate I notice THE follow _ powerport wire install NOT PER STANDARD wire practice maintain MANUAL CHAPTER XX THROUGHOUT FLEET._ powerport wire _ VOLT IS chafe BY underseat carryon item cause FIRE AND ELECTROCUTION HAZARD._ SEAT install maintain MANUAL _ procedure MAKE NO MENTION OF EITHER powerport OR NEW seat mount EPM wire.I RECOMMEND emergency AD._ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ THE report state THE LAPTOP COMPUTER SEAT powerport wire WAS contract OUT BY THE CARRIER AND THE WORK IS NOT UP TO approve maintain MANUAL aircraft wire standard.THE report say THE wire run FROM seat to seat IN _ column ON TOP OF THE CARPET AND secure TO THE seat WITH undersize PLASTIC TIE wrap.THE report state report HAVE BEEN receive OF wire arc AND IN vary stage OF DAMAGE.THE report say THE wire IS expose TO passenger underseat carryonbaggage AND HAS ALSO BEEN report AS A trip HAZARD.
202~WE WERE fly THE EXPRESSWAY VISUAL runway _ lga airport AND WERE follow traffic point OUT TO US.pass OVER dial THE captain call FOR THE GEAR flap AND land checklist.ABOUT THE sametime tower TOLD US WE WERE clear TO LAND AND THAT THERE WOULD BE A depart OFF runway _ PRIOR TO OUR arrive.I finish THE land checklist extend THE runwaycenterline ON THE flightmanagementsystem check THE commercialchart page TO SEE WHAT THE recommend TURN TO FINAL altitude WAS.WHEN I look UP I SAW WHAT I THOUGHT WAS OUR INTERVAL OVER THE THRESHOLD AND state THIS WILL workout FINE FOR THE runway _ depart.AS WE start OUR TURN TO FINAL THE tower say WE WERE cut OUT OUR INTERVAL AND FOR US TO CONTINUE TO LAND AND FOR THEM TO goaraound.IN FACT WHEN I look WELL OFF TO OUR right AN _ WAS turn A DEEP FINAL NO evasiveaction WAS require OTHER THAN THE goaraound.THE ONLY LINK IN THE CHAIN THAT I CAN SEE THAT MIGHT HAVE prevent THIS AND IT south A BIG on WAS WHEN WE WERE give OUR traffic TO FOLLOW I WAS SO BUSY I DIDN T PROCESS THE inform.WHEN I look UP AND SAW OUR INTERVAL OVER THE THRESHOLD IT WAS A TURBOPROP.OUR REAL INTERVAL WAS AN _.A valuablelesson THAT SOME inform WHEN miss BECAUSE OF be loadedup need TO BE ascertain RATHER THAN assume WHAT YOU SEE make SENSE.
203~ON THE LOUPE _ depart FROM sjc airport begin TURN AT _ distancemeasuringequipment.remain WITHIN _ distancemeasuringequipment AT ALL time _ degree BANK TURN.AS WE enter OUR climb TURN TO A _ degree head THE depart approach control call traffic AT _ o'clock posit WE WERE AROUND _ feetmeansealevel.AS WE WERE IN OUR TURN NOW head ABOUT _ degree THE control call ANOTHER aircraft TO OUR attention AT AROUND _ o'clock.WE WERE look BUT DID NOT SEE traffic.AT approximate _ feetmeansealevel AS WE WERE ABOUT TO leveloff AT _ feetmeansealevel WE GOT A trafficadvisory ON trafficalertandcollisionavoidancesystem _.THIS WAS JUST AS WE WERE complete OUR TURN TO _ degree.AT _ feetmeansealevel WE GOT AN resolutionadvisory tell US TO descend WE HAD NOT YET level AT _ feetmeansealevel.I stop THE climb AND begin A descend.THE trafficalertandcollisionavoidancesystem _ show traffic NOW AT _ feet ABOVE AND IN FRONT OF US.AT THIS POINT THE control TOLD US THIS aircraft HAD US IN visualcontact AND TO CONTINUE OUR climb TO _ feet THEN HE CAME BACK AND say TO EXPEDITE OUR climb TO _ feet.AT THAT MOMENT THE captain grab THE YOKE AND begin AN IMMEDIATE climb TURN TO THE right.IT look AS THOUGH OUR traffic THE TWIN CESSNA JUST SAW US ALSO.aircraftnumber _ quick veer TO THE right AND descend immediate.WE DID NOT CONTINUE climb BECAUSE resolutionadvisory WAS tell US TO descend.WE begin climb AFTER traffic WAS IN SIGHT.AIRSPACE FOR depart SHOULD BE classb.depart IS TOO BUSY TO BE look FOR visualflightrulestraffic AT OUR altitude.
204~short AFTER pass _ feet WE notice THE left fuelheat ON LIGHT WAS illuminate.THE left FUEL temperature WAS offscale HIGH AND THE left oiltemperature WAS HIGH AND approach THE yellowarc.WE accomplish BOTH THE fuelheat ON LIGHT continuous AND THE oiltemperature HIGH ABNORMAL procedure.NEITHER OF THESE solve THE problem.THE oiltemperature continue TO climb INTO THE yellowarc.SINCE AN engineshutdown IS require IF THIS CONDITION continue FOR MORE THAN _ minute I elect TO DECLARE AN emergency AND DIVERT TO RICHMOND WHICH WAS _ mile AWAY.WE land normal BUT slight overweight AT _ pound.WE SHUT THE engine DOWN AFTER land.THE oiltemperature WAS IN THE yellowarc FOR _ minute AND IT reach A maximum temperature OF _ degree.WE depart FOR mia airport IN A differ AIRPLANE sever hour LATER.
205~ON TANDY THREE arrive TO sna airport instrumentlandingsystemrunway WAS select inflight manage computer.waypoint ON THE arrive drop OUT OF BOX.THIS IS A WELL know problem WITH THIS SOFTWARE UPDATE waypoint WERE reenter on BY on BUT SXC WAS omit IN ERROR.AFTER PAROL aircraft turn DIRECT ALBAS.WE CAUGHT THE ERROR AFTER THE control notify US AND vector US BACK TO SXC.fortunate THE control CAUGHT THE MISTAKE EARLY WELL BEFORE A seriousproblem WITH OTHER traffic arise.
206~_ _ dfw airport tower runway.WHILE wait FOR takeoffrunway tower report THE WIND AT _ degree AT _ knot gust TO _ knot.THIS WIND WAS obvious IN ERROR SINCE THE windsock FOR runway WERE simple LIMP AND twist.FURTHERMORE THERE WERE NO front schedule TO GO THROUGH dfw airport ALL DAY.WE configure FOR A maximum TAILWIND OF _ knot takeoff AND TOOK OFF WITHOUT INCIDENT.DO WE HAVE TO ACCEPT tower wind AS limit WHEN THEY ARE SO OBVIOUS IN ERROR.I HAVE hear THAT THEY HAVE HAD difficult WITH AN ACCURATE WIND read us THE PRESENT equip.
207~aircraft X AND aircraft Y WERE be sequence FOR arrive IN THE PMM highsector AT ZAU.aircraft X WAS clear TO TURN DIRECT PIVOT intersect TO SEQUENCE IN FRONT OF aircraft Y AND TO MAINTAIN separate.aircraft X DID NOT TURN.THE SAME clearance WAS issue _ addition time WITH NO respond.separate WAS LOST between aircraft X AND aircraft Y AND THE control WAS remove FROM posit.THIS IS A highvolume COMPLEX SECTOR AND INATTENTION TO control clearance IS A hazardoussituation.
208~AT _ feetabovegroundlevel BIRD impact FUSELAGE BELOW captain south WINDOW.SPECIES UNKNOWN.
209~ON october _ I WAS enroute FROM KEYWEST flightlevel TO _ TITUSVILLE.approximate _ mile southwest OF HOMESTEAD COUNTY region THE right engine begin TO RUN ROUGH.AT on TIME THE aircraft roll TO THE right FOR ABOUT _ second.I WAS WITH ANOTHER pilot AND WE MADE A precaution land AT HOMESTEAD _.ON THE ground WE HAD A mechanic LOOK AT IT.HE say on OF THE FUEL cell HAD constrict AND WE COULD ADD FUEL TO EXPAND THE CELL AND WOULD BE FINE.WE proceed AND MADE A length RUNUP AND experience NO problem.THE remain flighthome WAS UNEVENTFUL.THE nextday talk WITH A FRIEND HE inform ME I COULD BE IN violate OF CERTAIN regulate.I WAS UNAWARE OF THIS AND THOUGHT WE WERE SAFE AFTER follow THE mechanic south advise.AFTER FURTHER THOUGHT I BELIEVE OUR mechanic SHOULD HAVE COME DOWN TO check THE AIRPLANE.I BELIEVE NOW THAT AFTER SUCH A problem I WILL HAVE A mechanic south SIGNATURE FIRST.
210~WHILE depart bwi airport ON THE SWANN _ standardinstrumentdeparture WE miss THE TURN TO _ degree AT _ distancemeasuringequipment.depart THEN TOLD US TO TURN AND JOIN THE depart.NO conflict WERE involve.PART OF THE problem DURING THE climbout WAS THE PRESENCE OF A TARGET ON trafficalertandcollisionavoidancesystem _.THIS distract BOTH OF US AND WE miss THE TURN AT _ distancemeasuringequipment.
211~WE depart ewr airport AND WERE climb TO THE assignedaltitude OF _ feet.ZNY advise US OF visualflightrulestraffic AT _ feet AND reassign US TO climb TO _ feet.I SET _ feet IN THE altitudealert AND READ THIS BACK TO center.WE level OFF AT _ feet.I THEN report THE traffic IN SIGHT.center ONCE AGAIN assign US _ feet.I READ THIS BACK AND SET _ feet IN THE altitudealert.THE firstofficer resume THE climb.center assign US TO ANOTHER frequency.I WAS set THE newfrequency IN THE RADIO WHEN I hear THE altitudealert GO OFF.I look UP TO SEE US climb THROUGH _ feet.I assist THE firstofficer IN push THE noseover AND begin THE descend BACK TO _ feet.WE GOT TO ALMOST _ feet BEFORE THE aircraft start BACK DOWN.level AT _ feet I complete THE frequency CHANGE AND contact THE nextsector.WE WERE THEN clear TO climb TO flightlevel.THERE WAS NO MENTION OF AN altitudeexcursion BY EITHER PARTY.I THINK THE firstofficer IS COMPETENT AND JUST MADE AN honestmistake THAT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PREVENT HAD I NOT BEEN distract by THE frequency CHANGE.WE HAVE recent install NEW communicate radio WITH _ digit.THEY ARE control BY _ knob THE large BOTTOM KNOB control THE digit TO THE left OF THE DECIMAL AND THE small TOP KNOB control THE digit TO THE right OF THE DECIMAL POINT.THE digit TO THE right OF THE DECIMAL DO NOT ALWAYS MOVE IN A LINEAR FASHION WITH THE turn OF THE KNOB.IF THE KNOB IS move rapid THE DIGIT CHANGE IS accelerate.WHEN YOU HAVE A require FOR A LARGE CHANGE IN THESE digit AND A RAPID TWIST OF THE KNOB IS us IT IS MORE like THAN NOT THAT YOU WILL gross OVER OR UNDERSHOOT THE TARGET frequency.THIS usual require AT LEAST _ MORE turn OF THE KNOB TO final GET THE CORRECT frequency select.THIS require WAY TOO MUCH TIME WITH YOUR HEAD DOWN special IN THE terminalarea.I THINK THERE SHOULD BE A SWITCH TO DISABLE THE thousand digit WHEN IT IS NOT require.THE SMALL KNOB COULD BE lift TO SELECT THE thousand DIGIT MODE OR ELSE us A KEYPAD TO ENTER THE frequency.
212~AFTER takeoff TETERBORO _ depart FROM runway _ state runwayheading TO _ feet right TURN TO _ degree MAINTAIN _ feet UNTIL _ distancemeasuringequipment FROM teb airport THEN climb TO _ feet.WE reach _ feet PRIOR TO THE _ distancemeasuringequipment.WE descend immediate.NO CONFLICT WAS APPARENT TO US.
213~aircraft instruct TO MAKE righttraffic runway _.pilot acknowledge AND subsequent WAS clear runway _.pilotreadback instruct AND clearance correct.pilot land runway.contribute FACTOR UNFAMILIAR WITH airportenvironment.THIS WAS EVIDENT ON groundcontrol WHEN pilot DID NOT FOLLOW instruct.POSSIBLE runwaymarking.FROM control south VIEW pilot sound AS IF HE WAS FAMILIAR.DID NOT QUESTION clearance WHICH lead THIS control TO PAY LITTLE OR NO attention ONCE instruct WERE give.WORKLOAD OF control obtain release FROM BAY approach issue trafficadvisory south TO aircraft ON RADAR coordinate WITH groundcontrol take handoff FROM BAY prevent THE localcontroller FROM scan runway AND THUS possible prevent THESE type OF occur.THE responsible place UPON limit RADAR control IS TOO MUCH AND SOMETHING SHOULD BE DONE TO ELIMINATE IT.SEE federalaviationadministration ORDER _ SECTION _ PARAGRAPH _ FOR A COMPLETE describe OF CLASS C service.COPY avail UPON REQUEST.
214~FOR OVER _ year NOW WHENEVER taxi northeast ON taxiway J FOR takeoff ON runway THE TRANSMISSOMETER LIGHT SOURCE HAS BEEN blind FROM DUSK onward.I HAVE report THIS TO THE tower AT LEAST _ time BUT NOTHING IS EVER DONE.THE SHIELD FOR THE LIGHT IS INADEQUATE AND need TO BE modify.IT WOULD BE VERY EASY TO PREVENT THIS problem BUT THE airport appear NOT TO CARE.
215~ABOUT _ minute AFTER depart WE receive AN UPDATE FOR OUR takeoff number.IT change OUR TAXI FUEL BURN FROM _ pound TO _ pound AND state ENSURE ALL TAXI FUEL IS burn BEFORE depart.SINCE WE DIDN T RECEIVE THIS UNTIL AFTER takeoff WE MAY HAVE take OFF overweight.THE overweight WAS NOT A structure LIMIT BUT A perform LIMIT FOR THE depart runway apparent WE receive AN aircraftcommunicationsaddressingandreportingsystemmessage PRIOR TO takeoff state THERE WAS AN update RELEASE.WE WERE BUSY DURING TAXI AND DIDN T SEE THE aircraftcommunicationsaddressingandreportingsystemmessage.MY LACK OF EXPERIENCE WITH THE aircraftcommunicationsaddressingandreportingsystem MAY HAVE cause US TO MISS THE MESSAGE.
216~I WAS approach trafficpattern altitude FOR land AND THOUGHT I HAD hear THE control clear ME FOR THE descend FOR land AT trafficpattern altitude.I WAS ALMOST AT trafficpattern altitude estimate _ feetmeansealevel WHEN THE control TOLD ME I WAS suppose TO BE AT _ feet AND TO climb immediate TO _ feet.SO I comply BUT I DO NOT REMEMBER AT anytime be restrict TO _ feet.I GUESS I LL WAIT UNTIL I AM CERTAIN THE control IS tell ME TO descend.THE RADIO STACK IS SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO HEAR IN THIS aircraft UNLESS switch ARE SET JUST RIGHT.ALSO THE PRESSURE OF on time perform MAY HAVE contribute TO ani misunderstand.THE LATE hour MAY ALSO HAVE BEEN A contribute FACTOR.PERHAPS write visualflightrules arrive procedure WOULD HELP.
217~WE WERE IN CRUISE flight ALONG AIRWAY _ FROM SEOUL TO ANCHORAGE ABOVE A clouddeck.THE captain WAS THE pilotflying AND COMPANY procedure call FOR number _ in AND A autopilot TO BE engage WHICH THEY WERE.IT WAS DUSK BUT WE COULD SEE ANOTHER aircraft south CONTRAIL.THE in show WE WERE track ALONG THE airwaycenterline.visual WE WERE track left UPWIND OF THE precedingaircraft south CONTRAIL.AT approximate intersect PLADO THE in south begin update FROM SYA SHEMYA veryhighfrequencyomnidirectionalradiorange.AT THAT INSTANT THE crosstrack ERROR show US _ left OF TRACK AND THE autopilot MADE A right TURN TO AN INTERCEPT ANGLE OF _ degree.WE note THAT THIS seem TO BE TOO LARGE A correct AND begin TO CONFIRM THE crosstrack deviate WITH THE OTHER system number _ AND number _.THEY ALSO show US left OF TRACK.visual WE cross THE CONTRAIL OF THE precedingaircraft AND expect A turnback TO TRACK.THE autopilot DID NOT MAKE A TURN AND WE note THAT THE number _ in STILL show US _ left OF TRACK WITH THE SAME INTERCEPT ANGLE.odd THE in crosstrack ERROR DID NOT DECREASE ani FURTHER EVEN THOUGH WE HAD A _ degree INTERCEPT ANGLE SO THE captain select A COURSE DIRECT TO PINSO THE NEXT POINT ALONG THE rout.THE aircraft turn AND track DIRECT TO PINSO.I select THE TRACK plado pinso IN THE number _ in AND IT show US STILL _ left OF COURSE.WE know THIS COULD NOT BE POSSIBLE SO ALL in south WERE change TO TRACK DIRECT TO PINSO.AS WE WERE make THE TURN TO PINSO ZAN notify US THEY show US _ nauticalmile right OF TRACK AND diverge.WE inform THEM THAT WE WERE turn DIRECT TO PINSO AND check THE equip.WE verify THE in posit AT PINSO WITH THE SYA veryhighfrequencyomnidirectionalradiorange AND ALL WERE IN agree.AFTER THAT THERE WERE NO discrepancy WITH THE in south.THE in south update normal automate WITH BETHEL BET veryhighfrequencyomnidirectionalradiorange AND show US ON COURSE.WE WERE UNABLE TO EXPLAIN HOW ALL _ system show THE SAME deviate left OF TRACK THEN NOT reintercept TRACK EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS MORE THAN A suffice INTERCEPT ANGLE.THIS entireincident seem TO HAVE take LESS THAN _ minute.TO BE _ nauticalmile right OF TRACK WOULD HAVE require A diverge head OF AT LEAST _ degree.THE captain submit A CREW report TO THE COMPANY.
218~land runway stl airport.EVERYTHING NORMAL UNTIL turn OFF runway.call clear IN between runway AND _.RADIO DEAD.switch TO communicate number _.STILL NOTHING.cycle avionicsmaster AND communicate CAME BACK.WAS clear TO TAXI TO RAMP.tower apparent HADN T miss US BUT I WAS concern FOR OBVIOUS reason RUSH hour AT stl airport AND apparentloss OF communicate.
219~I depart SDL visualflightrules FROM runway _.I MADE A right TURN AND WAS hand OFF TO PHOENIX depart control TO WHOM I HAD ask FOR AND expect radarvector FOR A visualflightrulesdeparture THROUGH THEIR AIRSPACE.I ask THEM FOR A transpondercode AND WAS TOLD THAT THEY WOULD HAVE A CODE FOR ME momentary.AT THIS TIME I notice THAT I HAD A GEAR in transitlight STILL ON WHICH mean THAT MY land GEAR HAS NOT proper retract.addition THE hydraulicpressure ON LIGHT WAS illuminate ON MY annunciatorpanel.I know FROM THE SCHOOL I attend ON THE AIRPLANE THAT THIS WAS A POTENTIAL emergencysituation THAT need TO BE resolve VERY quick SO I reach BEHIND THE copilot south SEAT AND obtain THE emergencychecklist.I fumble THE checklist AND IT FELL TO THE FLOOR ON THE copilot south SIDE I WAS ALONE IN THE AIRPLANE.I HAD TO takeoff MY seatbelt AND shoulderharness AND MY HEADSET BECAUSE THE CORD IS NOT LONG ENOUGH TO STRETCH THAT FAR OVER IN ORDER TO PICK IT UP.WHILE I WAS look UP THE CORRECT emergencyprocedure depart call AGAIN AND GAVE ME A beaconcode AND A head AND altitude.I THOUGHT THAT I COULD workout THE problem WITH THE GEAR AND proceed ON COURSE.IT SOON BECAME APPARENT THAT I WAS WRONG.I begin TO SMELL SOMETHING burn AND HAD A hydraulic FLOW lowlight ILLUMINATE.I know THAT THE MOST probablecause FOR THIS FACT PATTERN WAS A hydraulicleak IN THE NOSE COMPARTMENT.I inform depart THAT I HAD A BAD SIT AND need AN IMMEDIATE RETURN TO SDL.I WAS give vector AND altitudeassignment FOR A RETURN TO SDL.I DID A DOWNWIND FLYBY FOR SDL tower TO OBSERVE THE GEAR AND land WITHOUT FURTHER INCIDENT.UPON inspect AT THE fixedbaseoperator IT WAS FOUND THAT THE NOSE FENDER HAD BECOME twist IN THE NOSE COMPARTMENT UPON retract WHICH prevent THE GEAR FROM become lock IN PLACE.THE hydraulicpump continue TO PUMP UNTIL THE SIGHT GAUGE IN THE NOSE COMPARTMENT burn THROUGH THUS pump OUT THE hydraulicfluid INTO THE NOSE CAVITY.ONCE ON THE ground BACK AT SDL I contact THE _ tower AS request.I WAS inform THAT THEY THOUGHT THAT I HAD possible transit THEIR AIRSPACE WITHOUT contact THEM.IN RETROSPECT I THINK THAT I SHOULD ALSO HAVE declare AN emergency early IN THE PROCESS AND ask airtrafficcontrol THEN FOR AIRSPACE protect AND vectorsback TO SDL.know WHAT I KNOW NOW I WISH THAT I COULD REPLAY THE entireincident.I AM SURE THE result WOULD HAVE BEEN UNEVENTFUL._ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ THE report state THE nosegear FENDER BRACKET BROKE JUST ABOVE THE attach POINT.THE FENDER THEN seem TO HAVE twist WHICH prevent THE nosegear FROM retract.AS THE gearretraction PROCESS WAS INCOMPLETE THE hydraulicpump continue TO RUN.A continuous operate hydraulicsystem BECAME overheat melt THE PLASTIC hydraulic RESERVOIR QUANTITY SIGHT GAUGE WHICH allow THE HOT FLUID TO BE pump INTO THE nosegear WELL.AFTER return TO THE maintenancefacility THE pilot WAS TOLD THAT THE nosegear FENDER WAS know TO occasion FAIL IN THE SAME MANNER.
220~depart TETERBORO NJ WE WERE clear FOR THE teb airport _ depart.clear FOR takeoff AT _ AFTER _ minute hold FOR depart WE depart PER THE depart make AN IMMEDIATE right TURN TO _ degree WHILE climb TO _ feet.UPON reach _ feet WE turn left TO THE PNJ nondirectionalbeacon WHILE continue TO climb.WE notice WE WERE ABOVE _ feet AT ABOUT _ feet AND begin correct AT THE sametime NEW YORK depart inform US WE WERE ABOVE _ feet.WE continue THE depart WITHOUT FURTHER INCIDENT.ALL head AND altitude WERE brief PRIOR TO depart.WE HELD FOR takeoff AT teb airport AND WERE _ hour INTO OUR CREW DAY.I THINK THE LONG CREW DAY couple WITH A LONG HOLD ON THE ground create AN environ OF complacent AND degrade CREW alert AND aware.CREW SHOULD HAVE rebrief depart JUST PRIOR TO takeoff.
221~ON right DOWNWIND TO runway _ BOTH captain AND I switch FROM GPS MODE TO veryhighfrequencyomnidirectionalradiorange locate ON navigate select.approach check WAS RUN AND radio tune AND identify.approach GAVE ME A _ degree head TO INTERCEPT THE runway _ locate.THE locate ON THE right SIDE NEVER HAD CASE BREAK BUT THE captain south locate DID.NEITHER OF US CAUGHT IT.BECAUSE WE WERE IN A broke LAYER THE captain WAS look OUT THE WINDOW AND DID NOT NOTICE CASE BREAK ON hi locate NEEDLE.I WAS INSIDE ON MY instrument AND MY locate NEEDLE DID NOT MOVE.approach call AND TOLD US WE HAD fly THROUGH THE locate.AT ABOUT THE sametime WE BROKE OUT OF cloud AND SAW THAT WE WERE ALMOST line UP ON runway _.I begin THE right turnback TO runway _ AND recycle veryhighfrequencyomnidirectionalradiorange locate gps SWITCH.WHEN I DID THAT THE locate NEEDLE show fullscaledeflection TO right.THE captain state THAT THAT HAD happen TO HIM BEFORE.WHEN GPS veryhighfrequencyomnidirectionalradiorange BUTTON IS push THE indicate IS THAT navigate MODE HAS change WHEN IN FACT THE MODE HAS NOT switch AND therefor THE omnibearingselector NEEDLE read THE WRONG inform.ON MY PART I SHOULD HAVE crossreference THE captain south instrument AND HE ALSO SHOULD HAVE monitor hi MORE close.
222~earlymorning PRIOR TO EVENT I work A defer ITEM ALREADY ON aircraft OF left engine electronicenginecontrol _ STATUS MESSAGE previous minimumequipmentlist ED UNDER _.THE troubleshoot procedure suggest replace OF THE AIR OIL HEAT EXCHANGER VALVE WHICH WE DID NOT STOCK SO I supplement THE origin defer.HOWEVER I change THE minimumequipmentlist refer AS discuss WITH OUR maintain control represent TO _ WHICH require verify THAT THE AIR OIL HEAT EXCHANGER VALVE WAS OPEN AND remove AND STOWAGE OF THE VALVE CONNECTOR.I open UP THE engine PER THE minimumequipmentlist AND maintain MANUAL AND locate THE HEAT EXCHANGER ON THE left SIDE OF engine.us A MIRROR PER minimumequipmentlist I locate THE VALVE flapper AND verify THAT THEY WERE OPEN AND follow THE SHAFT DOWN TO WHAT I THOUGHT WAS THE AIR OIL HEAT EXCHANGER VALVE AND remove THE CONNECTOR AND stow.I actual remove THE _ BLEED VALVE actuate CONNECTOR inadvertent AND OR unknown.THE aircraft HAD A left enginecompressorstall LATER THAT morn ON takeoff ROLL WHICH I BELIEVE remove THE _ BLEED actuate CONNECTOR WAS THE CAUSE.SUBSEQUENT reinstall OF THE CONNECTOR AND engine BORESCOPE TOOK CARE OF problem AND aircraft WAS return TO serve WITH NO FURTHER problem.contribute factor I BELIEVE WERE LACK OF DETAIL IN COMPONENT locate ILLUSTRATIONS IN manual connector IN CLOSE proximity NOT be identify AND person unfamiliar WITH _ engine.THE maintain control represent WAS UNFAMILIAR WITH THE _ ALSO.WE HAVE HAD INITIAL train JUST NOT MUCH expose TO _.
223~JUST PRIOR TO PUSHBACK AGENT GAVE THE firstofficer OUR predepartureclearance.I WAS hand THE latestweather AND OUR takeoffperformance DATA.UNKNOWN TO ME THE firstofficer change THE rout IN THE flightmanagementsystem TO COMPLY WITH hi understand OF THE predepartureclearance.unfortunate IT cause US TO DEVIATE FROM OUR clearance.flight plan rout WAS phx airport DRKG DRK _ DTA slc airport.THE predepartureclearance say clear AS file phx airport _ DRK airway slc airport.I DON T KNOW WHY BUT THE firstofficer THOUGHT THAT mean airway ALL THE WAY TO THE slc airport veryhighfrequencyomnidirectionalradiorange.depart BCE THE control ask IF WE WERE go DIRECT DTA.THERE WAS NO CONFLICT AND I DON T BELIEVE THE control WAS TOO worry ABOUT IT.HOWEVER THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO POINT OUT HOW INCONSISTENT THE predepartureclearance south ARE.IT seem EACH on IS UNIQUE.YOU HAVE TO HUNT FOR THE departureprocedure SOME HAVE THE departurefrequency SOME DON T.SOME HAVE THE initialaltitude SOME DON T.SOME HAVE THE plan rout WHICH I THINK SHOULD BE LEFT OFF THE predepartureclearance SOME DON T.I D LIKE TO SEE AN identify BLOCK AT THE TOP AND THE TEXT IN THE SAME FORMAT us FOR year OVER THE RADIO FROM clearancedelivery.
224~I WAS INBOUND TO airport instrumentflightrulesflight instrumentmeteorologicalconditions WITH BAD turbulent.approach direct ME TO descend TO _ feet AND HOLD ON THE locate.I ask WHERE TO HOLD _ time BEFORE airtrafficcontrol reply.I WAS try TO FIGURE OUT WHERE TO HOLD.A FEW minute LATER approach say I WAS clear FOR THE approach AND TO contacttower WHEN establish.I contact approach AND say I WAS establish ON THE locate AT THIS POINT MY passenger WAS get SICK.I start MY descend ON THE locate AND switch TO tower.I THINK THIS IS THE POINT I LOST communicate.I THOUGHT I hear THAT I WAS clear TO LAND.I continue TO FLY THE approach.WE WERE real get bounce AROUND.I land.I hear ANOTHER aircraft ask THE tower ABOUT AN aircraft ON THE runway.I contact tower AND identify MYSELF say THAT I WAS ON THE runway.tower ask ME WHY I DID NOT CONTACT HIM.I say I THOUGHT I HAD AND WAS clear TO LAND.I apologize.HE ask ME WHERE I WAS park.THE OTHER aircraft WENT AROUND.I SAW THE OTHER aircraft OVERHEAD AS I WAS turn OFF THE runway AT ABOUT _ feetabovegroundlevel.
225~weather PACKAGE print AT _.weather PACKAGE expire AT _.WE taxi OUT AT _.flight WAS MADE WITH expire weather PACKAGE DUE TO be LATE BY _ minute.
226~WE WERE ON THE OKK arrive TO ORD AT _ feet.I WAS fly THE aircraft ON autopilot.I WAS momentary distract WITHIN THE COCKPIT JUST AS approach issue A descentclearance.THE firstofficer readback aircraft XX descend TO _ feet AND A TURN AND altimetersetting.THE control DID NOT CHALLENGE THE accurate OF THE READBACK.THE firstofficer AND I confirm _ feet SET IN THE altitudewindow AND WE start DOWN.pass _ feet THE control GAVE _ degree head CHANGE AND say MAINTAIN _ feet.I disconnect THE autopilot AND immediate initiate A climb TOWARD _ feet.THE firstofficer state TO approach THAT WE WERE return TO _ feet BUT THAT HE HAD give US _ feet BEFORE.PRIOR TO arrive AT _ feet THE control AGAIN clear US TO _ feet.THERE WERE NO trafficalertandcollisionavoidancesystem _ alert FOR traffic NOR DID THE control SEEM TOO concern.I KNOW THE WORKLOAD IN THE highvolume city HAS BECOME critic BUT I person THINK control verify OF READBACK clearance IS absolute ESSENTIAL TO traffic separate AND safe.I ALSO BELIEVE BOTH pilot SHOULD absolute BE SURE OF THE clearance PRIOR TO act ON IT.supplementalinformation FROM airborneclassificationnumber _ THE approach control DID NOT CHALLENGE THE accurate OF THE READBACK.THE captain AND I BOTH confirm _ feet SET IN OUR altitudewindow AND WE start DOWN.pass _ feet THE control GAVE _ degree head CHANGE AND say MAINTAIN _ feet.I THINK control verify OF READBACK clearance IS absolute ESSENTIAL TO traffic separate AND safe.
227~I WAS practice touch and go.ON THIS PARTICULAR land I HAD AN excess power AND speed WHICH result IN A BOUNCE.I SHOULD HAVE DONE A goaraound AFTER THE FIRST BOUNCE BUT DID NOT AND LET THE PLANE COME DOWN HARD AND BOUNCE AGAIN.THE secondtime IT bounce THE nosegear HIT THE ground HARD AND WAS damage.TO PREVENT A recur I WILL GET MORE train ON HOW TO BETTER MANAGE MY FINAL approach speed power AND confine AND MY decisionmaking ABILITY TO EXECUTE goaround.
228~DURING land ROLL ON runway _ lga airport WE hear takeoffclearance give TO ANOTHER aircraft.WE WERE THEN instruct TO EXIT THE runway AT taxiway right WHICH WE WERE NOT prepare TO DO.WHEN IT BECAME OBVIOUS TO THE control THAT WE WERE NOT clear AT taxiway right HE cancel takeoffclearance issue TO RJ ON runway _ AND I MADE A great EFFORT TO STOP BEFORE enter THE intersect OF runway _ AND runway _.SUBSEQUENT taxiinstruction WERE AMBIGUOUS AND result IN delay OUR exit THE runway SO airtrafficcontrol HAD TO ISSUE goaraound instruct TO A flight _ land ON runway _.tower supervise assure ME THAT THE train onduty HAS BEEN debrief concern THE shortcoming OF THIS procedure THE expect OF HOLD SHORT WHILE NOT issue landandholdshortoperations clearance restrict.
229~ON october _ AT ABOUT _ WE AN AIRBUS _ WERE ABOUT _ mile east OF SACHO intersect ON THE FOSSL arrive INTO phx airport AT flightlevel.ZAB issue A cross restrict TO US TO CROSS SACHO AT flightlevel.THE firstofficer acknowledge THE clearance AND I AS THE pilotflying SET flightlevel IN THE altitudewindow.AS WE WERE ONLY _ mile FROM THE FIX I decide TO START DOWN AT THAT TIME TO GIVE THE passenger A SMOOTH descend AND LEVELOFF.THE firstofficer call ZAB TO TELL THEM WE WERE leave flightlevel.THE control TOLD US TO MAINTAIN flightlevel THAT HE HAD NOT give US A clearance TO descend BUT THAT HE HAD issue THE restrict TO aircraft accelerate freefall AS WE WERE be call CFF THE FIRST NUMBER IS drop FOR airtrafficcontrol communicate THE callsign WERE SIMILAR.DURING THIS EXCHANGE I disconnect THE autopilot AND immediate stop THE descend AND return TO flightlevel.WE HAD descend ABOUT _ feet TO ABOUT flightlevel BEFORE return TO flightlevel.THE firstofficer advise ZAB OF OUR READBACK AND THE control retort THAT OUR READBACK WASN T import word TO THAT AFFECT BUT IT WAS OUR responsible TO LISTEN UP.I BELIEVE hi ATTITUDE IS A RESULT OF THE RECENT federalaviationadministration rule say control ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE TO CATCH error readback BUT pilot ARE RESPONSIBLE TO correct HEAR AND interpret airtrafficcontrol clearance.
230~A CESSNA appear THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD FROM BEHIND MY righthand WINDOW POST slight ABOVE MY assignedaltitude OF _ feet.I WAS ON A _ degree head track _ degree AND THE CESSNA WAS ON A COURSE approximate _ degree TO MY head.I evade THE OTHER aircraft WITH A descend right TURN BEHIND IT.UPON report THE occur TO approachcontrol THE control reply HE HAD A primarytarget BUT DID NOT KNOW WHO IT WAS.I acknowledge IT TO BE OK AS I HAD avoid THE OTHER AIRPLANE BY dive.I MUST BE MORE suspicion OF POSSIBLE UNCALLED traffic WHILE ON AN instrumentflightrulesclearance IN clear weather special WHEN fly slight ABOVE A CLASS D trafficarea THE _ feet CLASS D ceil MAY HAVE contribute TO THE OTHER aircraft fly eastbound AT _ feet TO AVOID CLASS D communicate.
231~WHILE follow THE HUDSON RIVER northbound IN A descend TO _ feet WE WERE give A clearance FOR THE RIVER VISUAL TO runway _ AT lga airport.AFTER receive THIS clearance WE continue OUR descend TO _ feet SO AS TO MAINTAIN _ feet UNTIL turn FINAL.AS WE level OFF AT _ feet approach call request OUR altitude WHICH WAS _ feet.apparent OUR clearance WAS TO FLY THE RIVER VISUAL AND MAINTAIN _ feet UNTIL ABEAM CENTRAL PARK.WE HAD readback OUR clearance AS clear THE RIVER VISUAL TO runway _ WITH NO MENTION OF _ feet ABEAM CENTRAL PARK.AS A RESULT OF THE misunderstand THERE WERE NO conflict AND approachcontrol say WE COULD MAINTAIN _ feet AND CONTINUE OUR approach.I BELIEVE THE SIT COULD HAVE BEEN avoid BY correct OUR clearance respond.
232~WHILE RELOCATING aircraft FROM ilm airport FOR HURRICANE depart ON AN instrumentflightrulesflight PLAN.ONBOARD WAS _ year OLD DAUGHTER ride IN frontseat.MY INTERCOM HAD fail JUST PRIOR TO flight SO I WAS UNABLE TO COMMUNICATE direct WITH HER.ON A flight PLAN FROM ilm airport TO fay airport TO rdu airport I WAS approach fay airport WHEN SHE appear TO COLLAPSE INTO THE control.AS I attempt TO EXTRICATE HER IT BECAME APPARENT I WOULD descend OUT OF MY _ feet assignedaltitude.I call FOR A clearance TO descend BUT WAS TOLD TO MAINTAIN _ feet.I TOLD THE control UNABLE.I final stop descend AT _ feetmeansealevel.control initial THOUGHT I WAS NOT instrumentflightrules rate.I LATER telephone THAT THE problem WAS medic DUE TO passenger incapacitate.IN FUTURE passenger WOULD DO WELL TO BE IN backseat AND possible THE INTERCOM SHOULD BE consider A GO NO goitem.
233~_ enter trafficpattern ON left DOWNWIND LEG FOR runway AT pdk airport airport.WHEN establish ON left baseleg FOR runway A HIGH WING CESSNA sudden report TO THE tower THAT HE HAD TO DIVE IN A left TURN TO baseleg FOR runway TO AVOID A _ ON A left baseleg FOR runway.THE CESSNA report A NEAR MISS.THE tower inform ME IN THE _ THAT A CESSNA ON MY left HAD TO DIVE TO AVOID ME WHILE HE WAS turn hi left baseleg TO runway.I WAS establish ON MY left baseleg TO runway.THE tower NEVER point OUT conflictingtraffic TO ME AND I inform THE tower THAT I NEVER SAW THE traffic AFTER THE tower inform ME OF THE report NEAR MISS.factor contribute TO THE SIT ARE left baseleg TO parallelrunway AT A busyairport control tower NOT point OUT CESSNA traffic TO THE _.THE _ HAD previous BEEN clear TO LAND ON runway BY THE tower BUT NEVER SAW THE CESSNA BECAUSE THAT traffic WAS NOT report TO THE _.suggest TO PREVENT reoccur ARE BETTER airtrafficcontrol AND communicate ESTABLISH left trafficpattern AND righttraffic PATTERN FOR parallelrunway.
234~WHEN power WAS apply DURING THE INITIAL takeoff ROLL THE COCKPIT door pop OPEN.THE takeoff WAS abort AT VERY lowspeed.THE pilot coordinate WITH THE flightattendant AND THE cockpitdoor WAS resecure AND TRIPLECHKED.THE flight THEN depart NOMINALLY.THE DOOR latch MECHANISM ON THE _ IS VERY FLIMSY AND companymaintenance modify HAVE MADE THIS WORSE.THIS TYPE OF INCIDENT IS become A day occur.
235~WE WERE fly A _ feet JUST PAST lan airport veryhighfrequencyomnidirectionalradiorange ON THE SPRTN _ arrive INTO YIP IN instrumentmeteorologicalconditions AND moderateicing condition.I captainpilotnotflying HAD JUST receive THE automaticterminalinformationservice AT YIP AND HAD switch BACK TO THE airtrafficcontrolfrequency WHICH THE firstofficer HAD BEEN monitor WHEN THE firstofficer start TO descend TO _ FPM.I ask WHAT altitude WE HAD BEEN clear TO WHEN THE firstofficer say WE WERE stall.I SAW NO indicate OF A STALL ON MY instrument AND AS I ask THE firstofficer WHY HE THOUGHT WE WERE stall I ALSO crosscheck THE instrument.hi airspeedindicator WAS pass THROUGH _ knot AND decrease WHILE MY airspeedindicator WAS show _ knot.WE quick determine hi pitottube HAD stop work.I TOOK control OF THE AIRPLANE AT _ feet AND climb BACK TO _ feet.THE problem WAS THE right SIDE pitottube HEAT HAD malfunction AND THE TUBE HAD BECOME ice OVER.I fly THE REST OF THE LEG BACK TO YIP AND write THE DISCREPANCY IN THE flightlog.

266~AT ABOUT _ distancemeasuringequipment ON THE instrumentlandingsystemrunway ORD WE experience A glidepath deviate ON THE approach.THE glideslope FIRST drop TO fullscaledeflection DOWN follow BY A SLOW move TO fullscale UP indicate THEN A glideslope FAIL indicate.IT CAME BACK normal IN sever second AND THE approach WAS continue visual WHILE monitor THE glidepath FOR THE remain OF THE approach.sever OTHER aircraft verify OUR indication WHEN WE notify ORD tower AND groundcontrol.THIS IS THE THIRD TIME IN THREE land ON THE runway THAT THIS HAS occur IN SOME DEGREE OR ANOTHER ON THE samerunway AND instrumentlandingsystem.I report THIS APPARENT MALFUNCTION TO ORD tower ON october _ AND october _ JUST AFTER MIDNIGHT.on aircraft say hi glidepath deviate WHEN A widebody depart runway UNDERNEATH HIM.ON TODAY south INCIDENT I DID SEE A _ depart BUT IT WAS BEFORE THE symptom occur BY ABOUT A MINUTE I BELIEVE.THIS need TO BE check AND EVEN flight check BY federalaviationadministration PEOPLE SOON.
267~obtain approximate _ birdstrike DURING land ROLL.WAS advise OF bird BUT WE assume THAT THEY WOULD HAVE LEFT THE PREVIOUS aircraft land.WE SHOULD HAVE chose A differentrunway UNTIL THE runway WAS know TO BE clear OF bird.nexttime IT WOULD BE safe TO NOT ACCEPT A land clearance.
268~flight PLAN HAD rout _.fsm airport CANNOT BE nave WITH A equip aircraft.THIS IS A recurringproblem IE DISPATCH file rout THAT CANNOT BE nave WITHOUT longrangenavigation.IF I AM WRONG AND IT IS APPROPRIATE TO FILE rout WHICH WE CANNOT navigate WHY DON T WE FILE radarvector DIRECT.IT WILL SAVE A LOT OF TIME AND MONEY.
269~I WAS IN THE trafficpattern FOR runway _ AT ugn airport WITH A studentpilot do land train.WHILE IN left traffic I WAS give instruct TO MY STUDENT AND became distract.I LET THE STUDENT LAND THE aircraft WITHOUT hear A land clearance FROM THE control tower AND UPON exit THE runway FOR taxiback I hear NOTHING FROM THE control tower.I THEN realize MY number _ communicate RADIO HAD fail WHILE I WAS IN THE PATTERN.I contact THE tower ON number _ RADIO AND receive A taxiclearance.I THEN learn THAT MY land HAD cause A HAWKER JET TO goaraound.I cause THE JET TO goaraound BECAUSE I land WITHOUT properclearance DUE TO THE communicate radiofailure.I CANNOT THINK OF anyway I COULD HAVE prevent THE INCIDENT BUT THE control tower seem TO BE LESS concern THAN I WAS AND THEY DID NOT ASK ME TO STOP AND TALK IT OVER SO I GUESS IT WASN T VERY SERIOUS TO THEM.

279~I WAS ON right DOWNWIND FOR runway _ AND WAS clear TO LAND number _ BEHIND A PIPER NAVAJO.THE NAVAJO extend hi DOWNWIND AND I ALSO extend MY DOWNWIND SINCE I WAS TOLD TO FOLLOW HIM.BEHIND ME WAS A PIPER ARROW.THE control TOLD THE ARROW THAT HE WAS number _ THOUGH HE WAS real number _ AND clear HIM TO LAND.WHEN THE NAVAJO WAS ON FINAL TO runway _ I start A TURN TO right BASE.THE ARROW WAS BEHIND ME AND request TO TURN BASE SO THAT HE COULD LAND IN FRONT OF ME.I ask THE ARROW WHERE HE WAS AND HE respond THAT HE WAS INSIDE OF ME.THE control say ARROW YOU ARE run THE SHOW.I DID NOT HAVE THE ARROW IN SIGHT AND WAS concern ABOUT A possiblecollision ON FINAL SO INSTEAD OF make A right TURN TO FINAL I decide TO CIRCLE TO THE left.THE control WAS MAD AND ask ME WHAT I WAS do.THE control vector ME BACK TO A LONG FINAL AND clear FOR takeoff A _ THAT HAD BEEN hold SHORT OF THE runway.I THEN land WITH NO FURTHER problem.TO AVOID THIS INCIDENT I SHOULD HAVE ask THE control WHERE THE ARROW WAS AND request verify THAT THERE WAS NO CONFLICT.I ALSO SHOULD HAVE immediate inform THE control WHEN I turn AWAY FROM THE runway.FOR hi PART THE control SHOULD HAVE us standardphraseology AND SHOULD HAVE clarify THAT I WAS NOW TO FOLLOW THE ARROW.
280~WHEN cruise AT flightlevel WE HAD A trafficadvisory follow BY AN resolutionadvisory.simultaneous WE hear center TELL AN aircraft flight TO descend BACK DOWN TO flightlevel AS THERE WAS traffic AT flightlevel.WE follow OUR resolutionadvisory AND climb AND notify center OF OUR action.WE climb approximate _ feet BEFORE clear traffic WHICH WE SAW visual AS IT pass AND descend BACK DOWN TO flightlevel.THE MINIMUM traffic separate observe ON trafficalertandcollisionavoidancesystem _ WAS _ feet.AFTER THE traffic WAS clear WE hear center clear THEM TO A higheraltitude.THERE WERE NO FURTHER comment MADE BY US OR ZJX AND I DON T THINK OUR climb impact ani high traffic.
281~LOSS OF separate.AT flightlevel west ON airway WE experience A trafficalertandcollisionavoidancesystem _ resolutionadvisory TO descend.ZDC say WE GOT LOST IN THE SHUFFLE AND DID A goodjob.WE descend TO flightlevel AND HIT _ MACH BEFORE correct BACK TO COURSE AND altitude.HAD WE HAD A BETTER radarscope system TO SEE THE TARGET BETTER IT MAY HAVE give US BETTER AND early warn.WE ONLY HAD THE _ nauticalmile AND _ nauticalmile RING SCOPE.supplementalinformation FROM airborneclassificationnumber _ WHILE proceed west ON airway approximate _ nauticalmile east OF HVQ WE receive FIRST A trafficadvisory THEN AN resolutionadvisory FOR AN aircraft AT OUR _ o'clock posit _ mile OUT AND close.AN resolutionadvisory occur THE autopilot WAS disconnect AND A descend WAS initiate follow THE greenband OF THE inertialleadorinstantneousverticalspeedindicator.A TURN TO THE right WAS ALSO initiate AT THIS TIME.THE aircraft pass TO OUR left AT approximate _ nauticalmile AND _ feet ABOVE US.airtrafficcontrol WAS advise AND A climb initiate BACK TO flightlevel.
282~I receive A weatherbriefing WHICH indicate THE freeze LEVEL TO BE between _ feetmeansealevel.ceil WERE general _ feet.addition JUST BEFORE leave THE fixedbaseoperator I meet _ pilot WHO HAD JUST arrive FROM NORTH CAROLINA.THEY confirm THE freeze LEVEL report.I file instrumentflightrules AT _ feet THE rout TO BE DIRECT BVT DIRECT alb airport DIRECT BWZ DIRECT teb airport.THE minimumenroutealtitude ALONG THE rout IS _ feet EXCEPT FOR A shortdistance JUST north OF alb airport.I feel THAT ONCE IN THE alb airport AREA PAST THE WORSE OF THE weather I COULD EITHER CANCEL instrumentflightrules OR REQUEST A rout TO CAM THEN ING TO KEEP OUT OF THE icingcondition.THE ceil south OF alb airport WERE predict TO BE high WITH teb airport TO BE _ feet scatter.AFTER depart I maintain _ feet UNTIL reach THE PLATTSBURG AREA THEN climb AND maintain _ feet.I SOON encounter RAIN freezingrain AND BOTH clear AND rimeice.I call ZBW TO INFORM THEM OF THE condition AND request A MORE east head AND loweraltitude.VERY SOON AFTERWARD I LOST communicate WITH ZBW.fortunate AN aircraft flight WAS ABLE TO RELAY between ZBW AND MYSELF.WE WERE give A head OF _ degree AND A descend TO _ feet.AT _ feet WE WERE STILL IN precipitate freezingrain AND ice.WITH THE HELP OF aircraft AND THEN ANOTHER commerce flight WE WERE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH ZBW.UPON reach _ feet WE start TO SHED THE ICE AND AT _ feet WE WERE BELOW THE ceil AND ABLE TO COMMUNICATE clear WITH ZBW AND THEN alb airport approach.THE REST OF THE flight WAS UNEVENTFUL.THE problem arise WHEN I WAS issue THE clearance TO MAINTAIN _ feet.I KNOW THAT THE prefer rout THROUGH THE EASTERN corridor ARE RIGID AND IT NEVER enter MY MIND TO REFUSE THE rout.I THOUGHT ABOUT cancel THE instrumentflightrules AND go visualflightrules BUT I THOUGHT THAT WITH instrumentflightrules I WOULD ALREADY BE IN THE system IN CASE OF NEED.AN additionalfactor WAS THAT I HAD advise custom IN THE remarkssection OF THE instrumentflightrulesflight PLAN AND I DIDN T KNOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF I cancel instrumentflightrules.AFTER think ABOUT THIS flight I BELIEVE THAT I SHOULD HAVE refuse THE clearance AND ask FOR MY origin flight PLAN WHERE THE minimumenroutealtitude south WERE AT _ feet.IN HINDSIGHT I BELIEVE THAT THE traffic control system IS NOT AS SENSITIVE AS IT COULD BE TO THE problem OF lightaircraft IN POTENTIAL icingcondition.lightaircraft SHOULD NOT BE rout INTO WHAT THE control KNOW OR SHOULD KNOW ARE potential danger condition.IN _ year OF fly I HAVE NEVER refuse A clearance BUT I THINK THAT I SHALL IN THE FUTURE IF NEED BE.
283~IT WAS A SIMPLE visualflightrulesflight FROM bdr airport TO MMK.MY FRIEND fly THE firstleg.AS WE climb TO _ feetmeansealevel WE WERE surprise BY HOW POOR THE forwardvisibility WAS.WE question WHETHER WE SHOULD CONTINUE OR RETURN AND decide IF WE descend TO _ feetmeansealevel THE visible WOULD IMPROVE.THE visible WAS POOR DUE TO HAZE.I ESTIMATE forwardvisibility WAS ABOUT _ mile.I fly THE LEG BACK.WE TOOK OFF AT ABOUT _ localtime.I climb TO _ feet ON THE WAY get THE automaticterminalinformationservice AT bdr airport.bdr airport report NO ceil AND visible BETTER THAN _ mile.WITHIN minute OF level WE SAW wisp OF cloud AND THEN BEFORE WE know IT WE WERE IN instrumentmeteorologicalconditions.MY FRIEND suggest WE descend BELOW THE cloud BUT I decide TO climb ABOVE THEM WE COULD TELL IT WAS NOT A THICK LAYER.UPON climb I contact NEW YORK approach ON _ AND ask FOR AN instrumentflightrulesclearance TO bdr airport.WE WERE clear basic fly visualmeteorologicalconditions BACK TO bdr airport AND land WITHOUT EVENT WE HAD THE instrumentlandingsystemrunway _ approach.IN RETROSPECT thing MIGHT HAVE BEEN differ IF _ I HAD descend immediate UPON see wisp OF cloud.MY CONCERN HOWEVER WAS HOW LOW I D HAVE TO GO._ THE temperaturedewpoint SPREAD WAS _ degree C.THIS combine WITH THE HAZE WE observe ON THE flight MMK AND THE settingsun low temperature MIGHT HAVE give US SOME IDEA THAT cloud COULD FORM AT low altitude._ fly DURING DUSK MADE IT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO SEE THE cloud.
284~WHILE cruise AT flightlevel receive clearance TO descend TO flightlevel DISCRETION TO flightlevel.I readbackclearance AND firstofficer begin descend.firstofficer was distract talk TO flightattendant AND DID NOT HEAR clearance._ feet INTO descend firstofficer notice aircraft BELOW US ON trafficalertandcollisionavoidancesystem _ ABOUT _ feet.WE stop descend ABOUT THE TIME center call TO ASK OUR altitude.WE state WE WERE climb BACK TO OUR CRUISE altitude AND refer THE previousclearance.center THEN GAVE ME A phonenumber TO CALL ON MY arrive.AFTER listen TO THE tape center supervise say THE control HAD BEEN relieve FROM DUTY AND THAT NO ACTION WOULD BE take AGAINST ME.THE originalclearance HAD BEEN FOR COMPANY Y NOT MY AIRPLANE.UPON receive THE clearance COMPANY Y TOLD THE center SOMEONE ELSE HAD take THEIR clearance.
285~A passenger WAS FOUND smoke IN LAVATORY _ UP TO AS MANY AS _ cigarette.BY THE TIME THE ALARM WENT OFF THE LAVATORY WAS FULL OF SMOKE LIKE FOG PEA SOUP.IN passenger PANIC TO GET OUT WITH ALARM go HE throw CIGARETTE BUTT IN TRASH CAN.WHEN I force DOOR OPEN THERE WAS SO MUCH SMOKE I feel panic.I WAS surprise TO FIND OUT NO ALARM go OFF IN THE COCKPIT OR AT THE number _ control PANEL.ON AN aircraft THIS LARGE THE SMOKE ALARM SHOULD ALERT OTHER flightattendant AND THE captain.
286~trafficalertandcollisionavoidancesystem _ resolutionadvisory descend FROM _ feet TO _ feet.WE GOT A trafficalertandcollisionavoidancesystem _ resolutionadvisory climb NOW _ FPM.WE stop THE descend AND start A climb AND THE resolutionadvisory COMMAND stop AND WE GOT A clear OF CONFLICT advise.resolutionadvisory last ABOUT _ second.NO visualsighting OF THE CONFLICT aircraft.I report THE resolutionadvisory TO approach.approach report NO OTHER aircraft WITHIN _ mile OF OUR aircraft.WE THEN start OUR descend TO _ feet AS clear.
287~DURING climbout TO flightlevel I select lateralnavigation AND verticalspeed guide ON THE flightdirector BUT forget TO ENGAGE THE autopilot.THE aircraft exceed flightlevel BY ABOUT _ feet FOR ABOUT _ second.I BELIEVE THE differ autopilot engage button WERE A FACTOR AS I HAD NOT fly A DASH _ IN OVER _ MONTH.THE visible OF THE engage light ARE NOT AS OBVIOUS AS THE PADDLE switch.AN additionalfactor WAS THE _ jumpseat observer.THEY WERE QUIET BUT I WAS try TO INSTALL THE sunshade DURING LEVELOFF INAPPROPRIATELY.TO RECOVER I handfly THE aircraft BACK TO flightlevel.airtrafficcontrol DID NOT MENTION THE OVERSHOOT.
288~AFT center fuelpump WAS ON maintain CARRYOVER AS WEAK.minimumequipmentlist say TO CONSIDER center tankfuel UNUSABLE.wingtank WERE FULL AND center TANK HAD ABOUT _ pound OF FUEL IN IT.try TO GET DISPATCH TO CHANGE FUEL number BUT BY THE TIME WE receive RELEASE AND NO REAL change WERE MADE I JUST MADE MY OWN SMALL change AND depart.THIS WAS SAFE BECAUSE THE differ between BLOCK FUEL AND MINIMUM FOR takeoff WAS _ pound AND WE ONLY HAD _ pound OF BLOCK THAT WAS UNUSABLE.THAT GAVE US _ pound FOR START AND TAXI.WE ONLY burn _ pound OF THE _ pound ON ground.
289~_ minute AFTER takeoff I WAS call BY BUSINESS CLASS flightattendant TO A passenger WITH sever CHEST PAIN._ doctor quick respond TO THE SUBSEQUENT PAGE FOR medicalassistance.AS ALL passenger involve WERE FOREIGN I act AS THE interpret TO KEEP THE CREW advise of the situate.THE medicalkit WAS retrieve BLOOD PRESSURE check AND NITROGLYCERIN administer BY A DOCTOR.hope THE CONDITION WAS stabilize WE resume THE MEAL serve.ABOUT _ minute LATER THE passenger WAS complain OF sever abdomen PAIN.on OF THE doctor THEN administer SOME OF hi person medic FOR THE PAIN.AFTER THAT fail TO WORK THE _ doctor discuss hi CONDITION AND determine THAT THEY COULD NOT MAKE A DIAGNOSIS THAT THE PATIENT south CONDITION WAS worsen AND THAT continue TO DALLAS WOULD jeopard hi LIFE.THE enhance medicalkit WAS us TO ADMINISTER AN IV AFTER WE move THE PATIENT TO A firstclass SEAT.HE continue TO APPEAR IN sever PAIN.hi medic HISTORY include SURGERY TO CORRECT AN abdomen AORTIC ANEURYSM _ year PREVIOUS.THE doctor conclude THAT HE MAY BE experience ANOTHER OF THE SAME.IT WAS NOT UNTIL I LET THE cockpitcrew KNOW THAT AN IV WAS administer THAT THEY seem TO TAKE THE EVENT serious.THEY VERY grudging decide TO LAND IN anc airport TO REMOVE THE PATIENT.AT THE TIME THAT DECISION WAS MADE WE WERE STILL _ _ hour FROM anc airport.THE flight WAS meet BY paramedic PATIENT AND WIFE release refuel AND continue TO dfw airport WITHOUT INCIDENT.THE PATIENT HAD A LONG SCAR VERTLY ACROSS hi ABDOMEN FROM hi PREVIOUS SURGERY.IT WAS trouble THAT ALTHOUGH I keep THE cockpitcrew inform OF unfold event THEY keep insist THAT THEY DID NOT WANT TO LAND.medic add TO THE IV WERE DIAZEPAM AND VALIUM.PATIENT south HEART RHYTHM WAS monitor us THE AED.OXYGEN WAS administer bywayof THE OXYGEN WALKAROUND.
290~threaten intimidate AND interfere WITH A flight crewmember.MRS passenger X elder HARD CORE alcohol.NEVER SHOULD BE allow ON ANYONE south AIRLINE.SHE threaten SHE see PINK elephant SHE say HER HUSBAND beat HER UNTRUE.CRAZY.nexttime WE WILL LAND AND LET HER OFF._ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ THE report say THAT THE WOMAN AND HER HUSBAND BOTH GOT ON IN wheelchair IN GATWICK AS THEY HAD BEEN IN SCOTLAND.THEY sit IN firstclass AND THE HUSBAND keep MUM WHEN hi WIFE TOLD THE flightattendant ABOUT HIM beat HER.THE report THOUGHT THE WOMAN WAS A BIT delusion AND VERY MEAN spirit AS SHE lash OUT quit vicious WHEN deny MORE drink.SHE WOULD GRAB THE report south WRIST AND PULL HER CLOSE TO HER FACE TO MAKE HER threat.THE HUSBAND JUST sit THERE AND drink hi MILK.THE WOMAN TOLD THE report THAT SHE WAS TOO OLD AND TOO FAT TO HANDLE THE SIT ABOUT get MORE drink SO SHE want TO TALK TO THE PURSER.THE report WAS SO DISTRAUGHT THAT SHE HAD TO AVOID THE WOMAN ALTOGETHER.THE PURSER WAS ALSO grab BY THE WRIST BY THE WOMAN AND AGAIN SHE MADE threat ABOUT be deny drink say YOU RE go TO BE SORRY.AT on POINT THE captain WHO HAD ALREADY BEEN inform of the situate STOOD IN BACK OF THE firstclass CABIN AND watch THE WOMAN south interact OF THE WOMAN WITH THE PURSER AND CREW BUT DID NOTHING ABOUT IT.THE report DOESN T KNOW IF THERE WERE ani repercussion FROM THE INCIDENT.SHE HAD give THE WOMAN AN AIRLINE MISCONDUCT FORM BUT THE WOMAN JUST TORE IT UP.SHE DOESN T KNOW WHETHER THE WOMAN WAS blacklist FROM HER AIRLINE.
291~flight WAS plan INTO aiy airport BADER WHERE A temporarytower HAD BEEN setup TO HANDLE THE expect highvolume OF traffic.usual BADER IS uncontrolled AND APPROPRIATE procedure WOULD BE follow.ON THIS flight WE WERE hand OFF FROM ATLANTIC CITY approach TO temporarytower AT BADER AND clear TO LAND.NO MENTION OF runway condition WERE MADE.UPON land THE left MAIN TIRE OF THE singleengineaircraft blow AND THE aircraft COULD NOT BE keep ON THE centerline AND veer OFF THE left SIDE OF THE runway INTO THE MUD.UPON inspect OF THE runway IT WAS litter WITH SHELL DEBRIS AND A DEAD BIRD CARCASS.I BELIEVE THE shell affect MY left GEAR AND WERE A majorfactor IN THE BLOWN TIRE.correctiveaction THE CITY SHOULD HAVE clean UP THE runway PRIOR TO THE EVENT AS A FEW OTHER plane HAD SOME smoke tire ON land probable DUE TO THE runway DEBRIS.THE CITY HAS MADE IT A know FACT THEY DON T WANT THE airport THERE EVERYTHING THEY HAVE NOT DONE IS A DETRIMENT TO THE airport AND THE aviationcommunity.
292~I WAS conduct A biennialflightreview WITH THE REVIEWEE WHO IS HIMSELF A certificatedflightinstructor.WE WERE _ mile north OF THE FIELD.I HAD NO ANSWER.I switch ON radionumber _ WITH NO ANSWER.I TOLD HIM TO RADIO XYZ WITH hi pushtotalk.NO ANSWER.I ask HIM IF HE WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE AREA.REVIEWEE TOLD ME THAT HE WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE FIELD AND THAT HE ALREADY HAD land THERE.WE WERE ABOUT TO ENTER THE MAGENTA shade CONTOUR OF THE CLASS east AIRSPACE WHEN I decide TO RADIO BOTH tower AND traffic.WE discuss THE radioproblem AND I assume THAT THE commontrafficadvisoryfrequency WAS NOT operate.REVIEWEE DIDN T SUGGEST OR MENTION A DOUBT ABOUT MY DECISION.I THOUGHT HE know THE FIELD AND THE commontrafficadvisoryfrequency operate BETTER THAN I COULD SINCE I WAS NOT FAMILIAR WITH XYZ.HE TOLD ME THAT HE need TO PRACTICE land AND WE keep OUR head TOWARD XYZ AT _ feet.WE enter THE BLUE dash LINE OF classdairspace AND I believe IT WAS downgrade TO A CLASS east SINCE WE HAD NO ANSWER ON THE commontrafficadvisoryfrequencyfrequency _.WE keep radio OUR posit altitude AND intent FULL STOP land ON BOTH frequency.WE radio ON BOTH frequency THAT WE WERE enter left DOWNWIND FOR runway _ BASE runway _ check FOR traffic IN FINAL AND call IN FINAL FOR A FULL STOP land.WE exit THE runway ON THE taxiway face THE tower seeming inoperative.WE radio THAT WE WERE taxi TO runway _.DURING THE taxi AND approach THE END OF THE taxiway WE SAW A CESSNA ON SHORT FINAL.IT DID A touch and go.WE wait OFF THE runway UNTIL THE CESSNA WAS AIRBORNE WELL ABOVE THE ground _ feet OR SO AND start it TURN OUTBOUND.WE taxi ONTO THE activerunway _ AFTER have radio OUR intent TO takeoff AND DEPART west ON BOTH frequency.WE TOOK OFF AND LEFT frequency _ mile OUTBOUND.UPON arrive groundcontrol TOLD US TO CALL XYZ tower.I call AND I talk TO AN unidentified PERSON WHO ask ME MY nameaddress person AND profession PHONE number AND MY medic AND pilotcertificate number.I FIRST TOLD HIM OUR tailnumber AND volunteer THE REST OF THE inform.HE ask ME IF I SAW A RED GUN LIGHT FROM THE tower UPON takeoff AND IF WE HAD radiocontact PRIOR TO enter classdairspace.I say NO.I TOLD HIM THAT I radio ON BOTH frequency AND THAT I THOUGHT THAT THE tower WAS inoperative.HE TOLD ME THAT I WOULD HAVE hear SOMETHING ON _ AND THAT THERE WAS NO NEED TO CONTACT aeronauticaladvisorystation SINCE THE tower WAS operate.I unfold MY CHART AND TOLD HIM THAT A CREASE HAD erase THE LAST DIGIT OF THE commontrafficadvisoryfrequencyfrequency _ AND THAT I dial IN _.I call tower _ minute LATER TO ASK TO SPEAK WITH THE manage.THE PERSON WITH WHOM I HAD ALREADY spoke TOLD ME THAT HE WAS THE manage.I ask HIM hi NAME AND AGAIN offer TO DRIVE TO AND SHOW HIM MY CHART WITH THE CREASE.HE decline.I TOLD HIM THAT I WAS concern ABOUT THE OUTCOME OF THE pilotreport FOR deviate AND I ask HIM WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO MY JOB AND LICENSE.HE TOLD ME I report THEY INVESTIGATE.contribute factor I trust REVIEWEE BECAUSE OF hi certificatedflightinstructor EXPERIENCE AND hi KNOWLEDGE OF THE AREA TO PROCEED TOWARD XYZ airport.THE SKY WAS EMPTY THE visible WAS GREAT.THERE WAS NO ceil.THESE factor lead ME TO BELIEVE THAT safe WAS NOT compromise.WE open OUR eye AND ear AND SAW on PLANE do _ touch and go AT XYZ airport.WE hear THE automaticweatherobservingreportingsystem AND HAD NO REASON TO THINK THAT OUR radio WERE OTS.I DOUBLE AND TRIPLECHKED MY read OF THE commontrafficadvisoryfrequencyfrequency see ONLY _ BLANK.HOW IT WAS discover OVER THE PHONE WITH manage OF XYZ tower.correctiveaction I dial BOTH frequency _ commontrafficadvisoryfrequency AND _ aeronauticaladvisorystation SO THAT WE COULD transmit ON AND MONITOR BOTH frequency.IN ACCORD WITH MY chiefpilot I WILL TAKE AN examine ON regulate federalaviationregulation part _ AND _.I WILL TAKE A CLASS WITH AN flightstandardsdistrictoffice represent ON THAT SUBJECT MATTER.percept blur BY MY read OF THE commontrafficadvisoryfrequencyfrequency OVER THE CREASE LAST DIGIT feel OF be SAFE WITH ANOTHER certificatedflightinstructor WHO HAD previousexperience OF THE AREA THAT I DIDN T HAVE AND WHO fly recent feel OF do THE RIGHT THING WHEN enter A CLASS east AIRSPACE SINCE i we assume THE tower WA.
293~WE WERE ON AN instrumentflightrulesflight PLAN AND clear FOR A VISUAL approach straightin TO runway INTO luk airport.THE control point OUT traffic TO US THAT WAS ON A right BASE ALSO FOR runway AND state BUT HE south visualflightrules.MYSELF AND MY copilot WERE NOT SURE WHAT HE mean BY THAT AND THE control seem HESITANT ABOUT WHAT TO DO WITH _ aircraft converge toward THE sameairspace.WITHOUT have US DEVIATE HE switch US OVER TO tower TO WHICH tower respond YOU DO SEE THIS GUY ON BASE RIGHT.AND WE acknowledge.WE ALSO TOLD tower THAT WE WERE make A _ degree TURN TO THE left FOR space AND MADE THE TURN.AS WE WERE _ degree INTO OUR TURN tower clear US FOR runway BUT WE state WE WERE UNABLE TO COMPLY AND finish OUR TURN AND HAD AN UNEVENTFUL land ON runway.IF WE DID NOT MAKE THE _ degree TURN WE WOULD HAVE end UP IN VERY CLOSE proximity TO THE OTHER aircraft.THE tower control seem UPSET WITH CINCINNATI approach FOR hand US OFF SO LATE FINAL.WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE problem WOULD NOT HAVE exist IF WE WERE hand OFF early FOR THE tower.
294~ON october _ AT rno airport WE WERE give THE OUTBOUND taxiclearance OF TAXI TO runway bywayof taxiway B HOLD SHORT runway.I readback THIS clearance AND assume THE captain hear AND understand THE clearance.AS WE approach runway I WENT OFF frequency TO MAKE THE flightattendant PREPARE FOR takeoff announce AS outline IN OUR standardoperatingprocedure.AS I return TO frequency IT WAS APPARENT WE WERE go TO crossrunway runway AND CONTINUE TO runway.I assume I HAD miss OUR clearance TO CROSS WHILE OFF frequency.I SHOULD HAVE clarify AND communicate WITH THE captain ON OUR initialtaxi clearance AND WHEN I return TO frequency.
295~HAD complete A NIGHT VISUAL approach AND land ON runway AT dal airport.ON ROLLOUT tower inquire ABOUT OUR destinate ON THE FIELD AND AFTER receive OUR ANSWER direct US TO TURN left AT intersect _ AND TAXI TO THE RAMP.HAD slow BUT STILL WAS ABOVE NORMAL taxispeed WHEN THE SIGN FOR intersect _ appear ON THE left SIDE AND start TURN follow WHAT appear TO BE A FOLLOW ME LINE.THIS turn OUT TO BE A hashmark ALONG THE SIDE OF THE runway AND THE aircraft end UP IN THE GRASS approximate _ feet SHORT OF THE ACTUAL TURN FOR intersect _.attempt TO taxion THE GRASS fail AND THE aircraft end UP STUCK.runway WAS close FOR approximate _ _ hour WHILE VERY help fixedbaseoperatorpersonnel pull THE aircraft BACK ONTO THE runway.NO DAMAGE OTHER THAN TO THE pilot south EGO.factor NIGHT operate AT AN unfamiliarairport ALWAYS A TIME FOR CAUTION.POSSIBLE pilotfatigue pilot HAD fly approximate _ hour THAT DAY TO REACH dal airport.I DID NOT FEEL fatigue BUT IT HAD BEEN A longday WITH SOME DIFFICULT weather ALONG THE WAY.easy MISINTERPED combine OF SIGNAGE AND runway SIDE mark.NOT AN EXCUSE BUT THE LARGE DISTANCE between THE SIGNAGE FOR THE TURNOFF AND THE ACTUAL TURN combine WITH THE locate OF THE hashmark approximate _ feet APART SO ONLY on WAS clear VISIBLE AS I start MY mistake TURN create A SIT IN WHICH A tire pilot expect TO SEE SOME SORT OF mark TO FOLLOW mistake THE HASH FOR THE TURNOFF mark.eager TO clear THE ACTIVE quick.THE aircraft WAS move AT SOMETHING MORE THAN NORMAL taxispeed WHEN THE intersect SIGN WAS pass.THERE WAS LITTLE TIME TO EVALUATE THE visualcue MORE critic.correctiveaction FOR ME JUST PLAIN BETTER ATTENTIVENESS LESS eager TO quick clear THE activerunway RESOLVE TO posit identify turnoff ETC AT UNFAMILIAR airport special AT NIGHT.FOR dal airport HARD TO SAY BUT I WAS TOLD BY fixedbaseoperatorpersonnel THAT THIS HAS happen BEFORE include A similarincident WITHIN THE pastmonth.MAYBE nexttime THE runwaymarking ARE repaint SOME THOUGHT SHOULD BE give TO modify THE hashmark SO THEY ARE LESS easy MISINTERPED.ALSO THE SIGN FOR intersect _ IS PRETTY FAR FROM THE intersect IT refer TO AND relocate close TO THE intersect WOULD MAKE IT easy TO posit identify THE intersect AT NIGHT.
296~_ pilot WERE onboard THE INCIDENT flight.THERE WERE NO OTHER aircraft involve OR EVEN IN THE VICINITY.I WAS act AS flightinstructor I AM A certificatedflightinstructor.I WAS conduct A flight REVIEW WITH THE OTHER pilot WHO IS AN instrument rate privatepilot AND WHO HAS MANY HUNDRED OF hour IN THE _.IT WAS NIGHTTIME THE weather WAS clear AND THERE WAS BRIGHT MOONLIGHT.IN prepare FOR A land ON runway _ AT ESN I HAD observe THE pilotflying PERFORM THE preland check AND I confirm THEN THAT THE land GEAR WAS DOWN.WHEN THE flight WAS ON SHORT FINAL FOR runway _ I AGAIN confirm THAT THE land GEAR WAS DOWN.AT ABOUT _ mile FROM THE approach END OF THE runway I say YOU CAN MAKE A touch and go OR A FULL STOP.THE pilotflying execute A goaraound.immediate AFTER THE pilotflying establish A climb ATTITUDE WITH fullpower I retard THE THROTTLE TO SIMULATE A LOSS OF power ON takeoff goaraound.AT THAT MOMENT THE aircraft WAS AT ABOUT _ feetabovegroundlevel AND _ knotsindicatedairspeed.THE pilotflying immediate lower THE NOSE TO MAINTAIN fly speed AND THEN establish A speed APPROPRIATE FOR land ABOUT _ knotsindicatedairspeed.HE maintain excel later control AND airspeed control WITH THE THROTTLE AT IDLE.I BELIEVE I SPLIT MY TIME between observe THE airspeedindicator AND THE aircraft south ATTITUDE AND judge IF THERE WAS suffice remainingrunway TO LAND.ALTHOUGH I observe THE pilotflying low THE flap TO FULL I fail TO check THAT THE land GEAR WAS STILL extend.THE propel AND THEN part OF THE UNDERSIDE OF THE aircraft STRUCK THE runway THE engine stop AND THE aircraft slide TO A STOP direct ON THE centerline OF THE runway ABOUT _ feet FROM THE END OF runway _.THE _ pilot shutoff THE FUEL engine IGNITION AND electricalsystem AND switch AND exit THE aircraft WITHIN LESS THAN _ second.AFTER A FEW moment WE observe THAT THERE WAS NO SIGN OR SMELL OF FUEL AND WE SAW THAT THE wing HAD NEVER touch THE ground WE HAD _ FLASHLIGHT AT THIS POINT.A FEW minute LATER WE return TO THE aircraft TO CONFIRM THAT THE aircraft WAS proper shutdown AND TO RETRIEVE addition flashlight AND A handheldtransceiver.assoonaspossible WE contact THE POLICE FIRE author bywayof _ AND THE airport manage notify THEM OF THE INCIDENT AND state THAT runway _ WAS block.WE monitor THE ESN aeronauticaladvisorystationfrequency TO NOTIFY ani aircraft THAT runway _ WAS close NONE approach OR depart UNTIL THE airportauthority arrive AND OUR aircraft WAS remove.I BELIEVE THAT ALMOST EVERY ACCIDENT INCIDENT IS THE RESULT OF A DEFINITE CHAIN OF event.WHILE MOST event OCCUR IN A sequence ORDER SOME RUN PARALLEL.properaction AT anyone OF THE KEY link WILL ALMOST ALWAYS BREAK THE CHAIN AND THE ACCIDENT INCIDENT WILL NOT OCCUR.ALTHOUGH THE CHAIN OF event IN THE ABOVE INCIDENT appear TO BE relative SHORT BOTH IN TIME AND IN SEQUENCE IT STILL require sever DISTINCT lapse ON MY PART BEFORE I woundup AT THE WRONG END OF THAT CHAIN.properaction BY ME ANYWHERE OR ANYTIME ALONG THE CHAIN WOULD HAVE keep ME AND MY STUDENT OFF THE ASPHALT THAT even.HOW THE problem arise I us badjudgement BY simulate AN engineout emergency AT NIGHT.IT WAS ALSO poorjudgement TO SIMULATE AN emergency follow THE pilotflying south goaraound.IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT HE WAS UNCERTAIN ABOUT SOMETHING AND MY add A simulatedemergency MUST HAVE contribute TO hi uncertain.THE FINAL AND MOST INEXCUSABLE LINK IN THIS CHAIN WAS MY fail TO check THAT THE land GEAR WAS DOWN.contribute factor humanperformanceconsideration contribute factor affect THE QUALITY OF perceptionsjudgements AND decision IN RETROSPECT MY perceptionsjudgements AND decision WERE influence BY THE follow contribute factor BUT THEY DO NOT IN anyway EXCUSE MY action OR inaction _ THE pilotflying IS on OF THE BETTER safe pilot I FLY WITH.I WOULD NOT SIMULATE AN enginefailure ON takeoff AT NIGHT OR DURING THE DAY WITH MOST OF THE pilot I FLY WITH.I DID SO IN THIS CASE BECAUSE I believe THE pilotflying WOULD BE ABLE TO HANDLE THE transit FROM A fullpower climb TO A power OFF GLIDE AND land._ WAS NOT terrible concern THAT IT WAS NIGHT BECAUSE THE V.
297~THIS flight WAS give takeoffclearance WITH restrict TO MAINTAIN visualseparation FROM THE precede takeoff A _.WE TOOK OFF ON THE samerunway AS THE _ WE WERE TO MAINTAIN visualseparation WITH.I LEFT THE flap OUT AND pull THE noseup AFTER takeoff IN AN EFFORT TO MAINTAIN speed COMPATIBILITY.I HAD TO TURN slight TO KEEP THE aircraft IN SIGHT AS HE WAS UNDER OUR NOSE.WE WERE out climb HIM AT A substance RATE.WE WERE BOTH assign A LEVELOFF OF _ feet.I TOLD THE firstofficer TO TELL THE departurecontroller WE turn _ degree right TO KEEP traffic IN SIGHT.HE respond departurecontroller ROGER.WE DIDN T TURN left BECAUSE THE OTHER parallelrunway WAS ON OUR left operate ON A differentfrequency AND I DID NOT WANT TO ENCROACH.ALSO THIS _ degree right TURN allow ME TO SEE THE _ OUT OF MY WINDOW.THEN THE departurecontroller GAVE THE depart _ _ degree right TURN.HE begin hi TURN THAT WOULD PLACE HIM IN THE NEAR FUTURE cross OUR flight PATH AT OUR altitude.I request A right TURN ALSO TO STAY INSIDE OF hi TURN.depart say NO AND remind ME THAT I accept responsible TO MAINTAIN visualseparation.I THEN TOOK A HARD left TURN WITH depart approve follow BY AN IMMEDIATE right TURN TO FOLLOW traffic.THIS PUT THE traffic UNDER THE NOSE OF OUR aircraft AND climb OUT OF MY VIEW.THE firstofficer TOLD ME HE COULD MAINTAIN VISUAL WITH traffic OUT OF hi WINDOW.SO WE continue THE SERIES OF turn.MY OPINION POOR traffic control AND frequencycongestion.

400~DURING BEFORE start engine checklist _ feet WAS enter INTO THE digitalflightguidance PANEL PER THE predepartureclearance.DURING check in WITH depart control altitude SET WAS confirm TO BE _ feet.AT _ feet depart control clear US TO _ feet AND WHEN THE pilotnotflying start TO DIAL THAT INTO THE flightguidancepanel WE WERE BOTH surprise TO FIND THAT _ feet WAS SET INTO IT.NEITHER OF US COULD REMEMBER enter THAT altitude AND WE confirm WITH depart control THAT WE WERE NEVER clear TO _ feet.AFTER review THE COURSE OF event UP TO THAT POINT NEITHER OF US COULD RECALL A TIME WHEN EITHER OF US MIGHT HAVE bump THE altitude SET KNOB AND decide THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN A MALFUNCTION OF THE flightguidancepanel WHICH WAS subsequent write UP IN THE LOG.EVEN THOUGH A MALFUNCTION MAY HAVE cause THE SET altitude TO CHANGE WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE vigil IN remain ALERT TO WHAT THE assignedaltitude real WAS IN ORDER TO PREVENT A MALFUNCTION OR ANYTHING ELSE FROM cause AN altitudebust.
401~park AT GATE taxiclearance WAS TAXI TO runway bywayof taxiway K taxiway left.UPON make THE left TURN TO FOLLOW taxiway K PARALLEL TO runway WE WERE TOLD TO STOP.WE WERE ask IF WE COULD MAKE THE right TURN ONTO taxiway west TO NOW TAXI TO runway _.WE acknowledge WE COULD.WE WERE IN FACT AT taxiway west ON taxiway K.WE WERE clear TO TAXI TO runway _ bywayof taxiway west AND taxiway south TO HOLD SHORT OF runway.I DID NOT HEAR THE HOLD SHORT OF runway WE WERE IN FACT hold SHORT OF runway ON taxiway west WHEN WE receive THE clearance AND I continue TO TAXI taxiway west AND taxiway south TO runway _.hold SHORT OF runway _ ON taxiway south WE WERE TOLD AGAIN STOP.I reply WE ARE stop AND hold SHORT OF runway _ ON taxiway south.THE control THEN advise ME THAT HE HAD TOLD US TO HOLD SHORT OF runway.I apologize AND HE indicate IT WAS NOT A problem.be THAT WE WERE ALREADY ON taxiway west SHORT OF runway AT THE TIME THE control change OUR clearance I FEEL betterunderstanding WOULD HAVE occur HAD WE BEEN TOLD TO HOLD OUR presentposition AND THEN BEEN give THE taxiclearance TO runway _ WHEN WE WERE clear TO TAXI ACROSS runway.supplementalinformation FROM airborneclassificationnumber _ I BELIEVE THAT THERE WERE sever contribute factor.FIRST THE SECOND taxiinstruction give WERE INCORRECT.AS WE turn right ONTO taxiway west THAT IS WHERE WE SHOULD HAVE HELD SHORT OF runway.THE add OF taxiway south IN THE instruct cause US TO THINK taxiway south WOULD BE WHERE WE WOULD HOLD SHORT OF THE runway.ANOTHER contribute FACTOR WAS THAT BY change THE takeoffrunway I AS THE firstofficer WAS IN THE PROCESS OF get NEW perform number FROM operate ON radionumber _.A THIRD contribute FACTOR WAS A newcaptain.THE captain WAS ON hi _ TRIP AS A newcaptain.IN SUMMARY IT IS ultimate OUR responsible AS THE pilot TO BE SURE OF OUR taxiinstruction AND TO COMPLY WITH THE instruct.fortunate runway WAS NOT AN activerunway.
402~WAS ON flightmanagementsystem flight PLAN ON A head OF _ degree AND WAS give A TURN TO _ degree.THE firstofficer SET THE headingbug TO _ degree BUT forget TO SELECT THE headingmode ON THE autopilot.AFTER A COUPLE OF minute approach ask IF WE MADE THE TURN.JUST PRIOR TO THE CALL WE realize WE DIDN T TURN AND HAD ALREADY begin THE TURN WHEN approach call US.look BACK ON THAT MOMENT IT seem EVERYTHING WAS happen AT ONCE altitude CHANGE head CHANGE IN THE MIDDLE OF A checklist HAD operate call US.normal THIS IS NOT A problem BUT OUR flight WAS UP UNTIL THIS POINT WAS strange QUIET AND I GUESS WE JUST GOT momentary COMPLACENT.fortunate WE recognize THE problem AND correct IT WITHOUT INCIDENT.
403~AFTER land roll OUT AT IDLE I brake TO MAKE AN intersect TURNOFF TO left.MY left HEEL slip OFF HEEL BRAKE.PLANE turn TO THE right AND OFF runway come TO STOP ON DIRT.THE DIRT WAS SOFT AND aircraft stop A BIT quick THAN ON A hardsurface AND nose OVER ENOUGH TO CATCH THE propel.on BLADE turn THROUGH DIRT SECOND BLADE stop engine.propel BENT TAILWHEEL BENT AT LONGERON WHEN IT CAME BACK DOWN AFTER NOSEOVER TOTAL DAMAGE assess IS IN PROGRESS.I DON T BELIEVE propel WOULD HAVE BEEN damage IF DIRT SURFACE WAS NOT soften DUE TO RAIN IN previousday.

556~A passenger experience PAIN IN hi low CHEST AND believe IT TO BE INDIGESTION.IT turn OUT TO BE HEART STROKE STROKE DID NOT OCCUR ON aircraft._ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ THE report state THAT THEY divert TO LUBBOCK TX SO THE MAN COULD BE take TO A HOSPITAL.SHE call hi FAMILY FROM THE ground IN LUBBOCK TO TELL THEM WHAT happen.hi FAMILY TOLD HER THAT THE MAN HAD A HISTORY OF HEART problem AND HAD JUST undergo OPEN HEART SURGERY.SHE call THEM AGAIN FROM SAN FRANCISCO AND learn THAT HE HAD HAD A STROKE.
557~I WAS call BY MR.X AT CREW schedule.HE inform ME I HAD A TRIP leave THE nextday WITH AN _ morn report TIME.I inform THE schedule THAT I WAS A LONG CALLOUT RESERVE AND need _ hour NOTICE.HE inform ME HE HAD LEFT A MESSAGE early AT MY HOUSE AND THAT THE _ hour COULD BE reduce TO _ hour.I question WHETHER OR NOT THAT WAS LEGAL AND ask WHO COULD MAKE THAT DECISION.HE say HE WOULD CALL hi supervise AND FIND OUT.approximate _ minute LATER I WAS call AGAIN BY ANOTHER schedule MR.Y AND TOLD THAT HE WAS NOT go TO CALL supervise AND THAT I WAS LEGAL FOR THE TRIP.I AGAIN question THE legal OF THE TRIP AND WHY I WAS NOT call soon BY MY PAGER OR CELL PHONE.WHEN I DID ARRIVE HOME THERE WAS A MESSAGE ON MY answer MACHINE regard THE TRIP.AFTER THE HOLIDAYS WERE OVER I contact chiefpilot ABOUT OTHER matter AND ALSO ask HIM WHETHER OR NOT THE TRIP WAS LEGAL.HE inform ME THAT schedule SHOULD HAVE try contact ME BY THE _ number I HAVE give TO CREW schedule.HE inform ME HE DIDN T THINK I WAS LEGAL FOR THE TRIP.I FURTHER check WITH supervise AND AFTER look AT THE COMPUTER ENTRY THE log reflect A TIME IN WHICH CASE IT WAS determine I WAS NOT LEGAL FOR THE TRIP.I BELIEVE THE problem WAS cause BY IMPROPER train OF CREW schedule AND interpret OF THE CONTRACTUAL agree OF THE COMPANY WITH THE UNION CONTRACT WHICH state THEY WILL callup TO _ number provide BY THE pilot.ALSO THE misunderstand OF THE NEW federalaviationregulation IN regard TO RESERVE pilot restrequirement WHICH HAD BEEN IN EFFECT FOR LESS THAN _ week.
558~AFTER DARK ON january _ WE taxi OUR LEAR _ FROM LAS VEGAS EXECUTIVE TERMINAL AT LAS airport TO runway.WE HELD SHORT AT taxiway _.IT WAS quit BUSY AND WE HAD wait AT LEAST _ minute BEFORE THE tower clear US.THERE ARE GREEN taxiwaycenterline light AT THAT intersect THAT CONTINUE ACROSS THE runway AND ON TOWARD THE MAIN TERMINAL.I look left AND right make SURE IT WAS clear AND AS WE finish UP THE finalitem ON THE lineup checklist I look AHEAD AGAIN AND turn left TO lineup ON THE runwaycenterline light.ON THE takeoff ROLL I align THE aircraft SO THAT THE NOSEWHEEL WAS OFFSET slight TO THE left OF THE light TO KEEP THE NOSEWHEEL FROM roll ACROSS THE FLUSH mount light.AFTER approximate _ DOZEN light WENT BY I SAW THAT THE NEXT LIGHT WAS NOT FLUSH BUT mount ON A STANCHION ABOUT _ feet HIGH.THE runwayedge light IS FLUSH mount exact LIKE centerline light ON THE righthand SIDE OF runway IN THIS AREA.THIS IS apparent TO ALLOW aircraft ACCESS TO THE runway FROM A LARGE ramparea NOT JUST A taxiway AND I HAD mistake THE edgelight FOR centerlinelight I swerve left BECAUSE I COULDN T JUDGE quick ENOUGH WHETHER WE COULD STRADDLE THE LIGHT.IT WASN T ENOUGH AND WE RAN OVER THE LIGHT WITH THE right maingear AT ABOUT _ knot.I discontinue THE takeoff AND notify THE tower THAT WE need TO RETURN TO EXECUTIVE.I TOLD THEM WE HAD HIT A LIGHT AND ask THAT SOMEONE check IT OUT BY VEHICLE.WE return TO THE RAMP AND I inform THE passenger WE HAD RUN OVER SOMETHING AND need TO INSPECT THE tire.AFTER SHUTDOWN AND WITH A FLASHLIGHT I careful inspect BOTH tire AND FOUND ONLY A SUPERFICIAL CUT AND scrape ON THE OUTBOARD MAIN.I inspect THE geardoor HINGE AND actuate MAIN STRUT BRAKE line antiskid wire WHEEL WELL AND WING FLAP AND discover NO DAMAGE.WE continue THE flight uneventful.UPON terminate OF THE flight I write UP THE TIRE CUT FOR maintain TO check AN inoperative land LIGHT.THE nextday maintenancepersonnel decide TO CHANGE THE TIRE EVEN THOUGH IT WAS STILL service.THEY ALSO discover foreignobjectdamage TO THE right engine A possible I HAD NOT EVEN consider.apparent AS THE LIGHT STANCHION BROKE OVER A PIECE WAS throw FORWARD AND bounce OFF THE runway HIGH ENOUGH TO BE ingest.prevent _ AS THE pilot check light avail ON THE runway TO BE us.I COULD HAVE FOUND OUT FROM THE chart THERE IS NO centerline light ON THIS runway._ THIS intersect IS us FOR depart OFTEN BECAUSE OF runway _.fulllength departure WOULD INTERFERE SO THE takeoff ROLL begin RIGHT ABOUT WHERE land jet OBLITERATE runwaymarking WITH TIRE RUBBER.THE paint mark ARE DIMLY VISIBLE STILL HOWEVER AND CAN BE see IF YOU PAY CLOSE attention._ INSTALL centerline light ON THIS runway FOR THE FIRST _ feet TO PREVENT THE edgelighting FROM be confuse WITH centerline light.
559~clear FOR takeoff flight _.PRIOR TO rotate observe aircraft _ cross runway.FIRST THOUGHT _ WAS ON taxiway U THEN SAW IT WAS ON taxiway _.lightaircraft weigh enable suffice clearance AFTER rotate.WAS ask BY tower TO CALL THEM UPON arrive MAD.WE DID AND THEY say THEY SAW _ ON taxiway _ JUST AS WE WERE rotate AND DID NOT WANT TO SAY ANYTHING.THEY say A complain WAS be file ON THE _ CREW.
560~AFTER depart FROM airport AND AT FLAP retract altitude WE proceed TO RETRACT THE flap FOR climbout.WE THEN receive AN engineindicationandcrewalertingsystem CAUTION MESSAGE state THAT OUR flap HAD fail OR stop operate IN THE INTERMEDIATE posit.WE refer OUR companyflight MANUAL AFTER proceed OUTSIDE OF THE IMMEDIATE trafficpattern AREA CORRIDOR.OUR checklist FOR THIS abnormal instruct US TO LAND AT near suitableairport.WE MADE THE DECISION base ON goodweather AND departureairport GOOD aircraftperformance control AND OTHER factor TO RETURN TO departureairport.WE land uneventful deplane OUR passenger AND call maintenancepersonnel.WE NEVER DID DECLARE AN emergency AS OUR companyflight MANUAL mandate.WE feel our situate DID NOT WARRANT SUCH A DECLARATION.
561~THIS MAN CAME BACK TO THE GALLEY AND start scream AT ME INCOHERENTLY.AT FIRST I HAD NO IDEA WHAT HE WAS talk ABOUT.apparent THE PURSER ask HIM TO TAKE hi SEAT SINCE THE seatbeltsign WAS ON AND IT WAS bump.SHE WAS ON HER wayback TO firstclass.IT BECAME APPARENT HE WAS intoxicate TO HAVE SUCH A CHANGE IN DISPOSITION AND HE BECAME IRATE OVER be TOLD THE seatbeltsign WAS ON say HE DIDN T HAVE TO SIT DOWN THAT WE obvious DIDN T HAVE child THAT HE HAD live IN feet WORTH FOR _ year AND continue scream AT ME WHEN I say THE PURSER WAS JUST do HER JOB TO ADVISE HIM OF THE seatbeltsign.HE WASN T EVEN COHERENT.I call THE COCKPIT TO SEE IF THEY COULD CALM HIM DOWN AND EXPLAIN WHY HE need TO BE seat.ALSO I WAS scare BACK THERE BY MYSELF.ABOUT THE TIME I try TO GET HIM TO TALK TO THE captain ANOTHER flightattendant CAME BACK THEN HE start scream AT HER.THE captain TOLD ME TO wakeup THE COCKPIT MEMBER ON BREAK AND GET HIM TO COME BACK.WHEN I LEFT TO GET HIM HE real start IN ON THE OTHER flightattendant AND SHE THOUGHT HE WAS go TO HIT HER.THE cockpitcrew bring A MALE flightattendant BACK WITH HIM AND HE TOLD THE MAN TO SIT DOWN NOT SAY ANOTHER WORD AND NOT TO GET OUT OF hi SEAT TILL WE WERE IN dfw airport.HE comply WITH THE captain south order.supplementalinformation FROM airborneclassificationnumber _ THE flightattendant serve HIM say HE HAD A LOT OF WINE AND HAD TO TAKE A BOTTLE FROM HIM THAT HE HAD bring onboard.FOR THE firsttime IN _ year OF be A flightattendant I real HAD A feel I WAS go TO BE HIT.A YOUNG malepassenger hear IT ALL.HE GAVE US hi NAME AS A wit.flightattendant serve HIM DID NOT KNOW UNTIL LATER IN THE flight THAT HE HAD hi OWN BOTTLE.
562~flight push FROM GATE.ground WAS VERY BUSY WITH numerousaircraft request move.AFTER PUSH ground ask IF WE WERE READY FOR TAXI TO clear THE ALLEY AND I respond THAT WE WERE.THERE WAS NO respond SO A MOMENT LATER I request TAXI.A PREVIOUS aircraft HAD BEEN TOLD TO HOLD SHORT WHICH MADE ME ALERT TO THAT possible.HOLD SHORT OF runway enroute TO runway TO THE BEST OF MY recollect ground TOLD US TO TAXI AFTER THE SECOND pass aircraft pass right TO left ON taxiway east TO runway.I respond BEHIND THE secondaircraft TO runway.AS WE approach runway THE captain ask IF WE WERE clear TO runway AND I confirm WE WERE TO HIM BUT NOT WITH ground.WHEN WE cross THE HOLD SHORT LINE ground TOLD US WE WERE NOT clear ACROSS.THEY TOLD US TO EXPEDITE ACROSS AND TO MAINTAIN SAFE clearance SENT A COMMUTER AROUND FROM ABOUT _ nauticalmile FINAL.analyze ground WAS VERY BUSY.THEY EITHER confuse WHAT THEY TOLD US TO DO OR I SOMEHOW miss THE clearance.IN EITHER CASE I DID NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THE HOLD SHORT instruct.FIX know thing WERE VERY BUSY WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN gear TO MORE PRECAUTION.WHEN THE captain express THE SLIGHTEST DOUBT ABOUT THE clearance I SHOULD HAVE confirm IT WITH ground BEFORE penetrate runway.PS.WE talk WITH THE mdw airport supervise.HE say NO SAFE distance WERE penetrate.HE HAD NOT review tape AT THAT TIME.supplementalinformation FROM airborneclassificationnumber _ THEY reply THAT WE WERE NOT clear TO crossrunway runway AND THAT WE WERE TOLD TO HOLD SHORT OF runway.
563~AFTER depart pao airport runway _ WITH A right turnout AT THE DUMBARTON BRIDGE I proceed ON A COURSE northnortheast TOWARD lvk airport airport.I stay UNDER _ feet UNTIL I cross THE WATER BAY THEN climb TO GET ABOVE A LAYER OF MIST.AT _ o'clock posit move TO MY _ o'clock posit I encounter A commerce airline AT approximate MY altitude AND _ mile AWAY close FAST.THE airline bank approximate _ degree TO THE right AND I DID THE SAME AN AGGRESSIVE climb AND TURN TO MY right.short THEREAFTER pao airport tower release ME TO CONTACT center FOR flight follow.THERE WAS NO MENTION OF THE traffic BY pao airport south tower TO ME.I immediate request flight follow visualflightrules FROM BAY approach.THEIR control subsequent inform ME THAT THEY observe ABRUPT change IN MY altitude MODE C BUT MADE NO MENTION OF THE potentialconflict WITH AN airline.WHEN I arrive IN SACRAMENTO AT SAC airport I TOOK THE AIRPLANE IN TO HAVE THE transpond south MODE C check.NO problem WITH MODE C.contribute factor _ MIST BELOW approximate _ feetmeansealevel._ center assume MY OPINION THAT MY MODE C WAS ERRATIC WHEN IN FACT I climb rapid TO GET ABOVE THE poorvisibility.
564~AS I retard THE throttle AT TOP OF descend number _ enginevibration LIGHT CAME ON pilot south CAUTION AND warningpanel.LIGHT ALSO CAME ON AT SO STATION.LEFT number _ THROTTLE AT IDLE AND work abnormalprocedure IN accord WITH pilotsoperatingmanual.AS direct BY pilotsoperatingmanual I advance number _ THROTTLE AND vibrate increase peg OUT.WE THEN shutdownnumber _ engine declare AN emergency AND receive handle FROM atl airport approach TO THE instrumentlandingsystem TO runway.UNEVENTFUL land WAS MADE AND THE emergencyequipment WAS THEN release.TAXI TO GATE UNASSISTED WAS NORMAL.IN SHORT WE handle IT LIKE WE WERE train TO HANDLE IT IN train.
565~ON taxiout FROM GATE AT sfo airport THE forwardlavatory FIRE ALARM sound.WHILE SO WAS investigate THE firstofficer smell AN electric SMELL.FIRE AND RESCUE WAS call OUT AS WE DID A PRIORITY RETURN TO THE GATE.PRIOR TO OUR gatearrival OUR emergency BUS OFF LIGHT illuminate.SMOKE AND fume WERE APPARENT ALSO IN THE aircondition FOR THE CABIN.THERE WAS A SLIGHT DELAY deplane OUR passenger THROUGH DOOR runway us THE JETWAY DUE TO A hesitate BY THE flightattendant OF BOTH disarm THE DOOR AND NOT realize THAT OUR electric HAD fail render THE NORMAL electric mean OF open THE DOOR inoperative.THE SO quick open DOOR runway us THE PNEUMATIC BACKUP.THE cabincrew ALL flightattendant AND THE SO WENT TO THE airport CLINIC FOR evaluate OF SMOKE AND FUME INHALATION ETC.BOTH THE captain AND firstofficer choose NOT TO.THEY WERE us oxygenmask DURING THE emergency procedure.NO passengerinjury WERE report NOR expect._ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ THE report state THAT THE aircraft WAS take TO THE maintenancehangar FOR A COMPLETE REVIEW OF THE problem.THE relate SIT COULD NOT BE REPRODUCED.HOWEVER NUMEROUS mechanicalproblem WERE FOUND TO EXIT.THE LOGBOOK DID NOT REVEAL ani note correct TO THE origin problem AREA BUT DID NOTE _ INCH CRACK IN THE BLEED VALVE ON on engine AND OIL IN number _ engine duct.firstofficer feel THAT THE ISSUE WAS IN THE low east and east COMPARTMENT.DURING THE EVENT THE firstclass cabinattendant CAME TO THE COCKPIT AND SAW VISIBLE SMOKE OR HAZE WHICH THE CREW HAD NOT see.THEIR mask WERE ALREADY ON AT THIS POINT._ day LATER A FERRY CREW HAD THE SAME SMELL OF electric odor IN THE aircraft DURING THEIR flight TO THE maintain OVERHAUL airport.THIS EVENT WAS review WITHIN THE COMPANY WITH THE unionsafety representative AND THE federalaviationadministration THERE FOR THE hear.

616~THE flight origin WITHOUT INCIDENT UNTIL THE aircraft pass THROUGH _ feet.IT WAS AT THIS TIME THE cabinaltitudewarning CAME ON.UPON run THE appropriatechecklist IT WAS discover THAT THE aircondition pack WERE SET IN THE WRONG posit.I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS WAS A procedure problem.I WAS IN A HURRY do sever thing AT ONCE.WHEN perform THE TAXI takeoff AND AFTER takeoff checklist THE posit OF THE aircondition PACK switch appear TO BE IN THE CORRECT posit.THE problem COULD HAVE BEEN discover early IF THE pressurize indicate HAD A differ DESIGN.THE AFTER takeoffchecklist require consult THE pressurize indicate.WHEN I DID THIS THE pressurize DIFFERENTIAL look NORMAL.IN add I feel UNUSUAL PRESSURE change IN MY ear WHICH MADE ME AGAIN CONSULT THE PRESSURE indicate.AS IT turn OUT WHAT I WAS look AT WAS THE cabinaltitude NOT THE pressurize DIFFERENTIAL.BOTH OF THESE QUANTITIES ARE READ FROM THE SAME number ON THE SAME GAUGE.SO WHEN I SAW WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A PRESSURE DIFFERENTIAL OF _ poundspersquareinch WHAT I WAS real look AT WAS A cabinaltitude OF _ feet.IT WASN T UNTIL THE cabinaltitude ALARM WENT OFF THAT I realize THAT I WAS look AT THE WRONG NEEDLE.AS SOON AS I realize THIS I know WHAT THE problem WAS.supplementalinformation FROM airborneclassificationnumber _ THROUGH THE execute OF THIS checklist WE discover THE firstofficer HAD forget TO turnon THE aircondition pressurize pack AND AS A RESULT THE CABIN HAD NOT pressurize.AT THE TIME OF THE ALERT I WAS handfly THE aircraft IN nightinstrumentflightrules condition WITH ICE AND RAIN VISIBLE.BECAUSE I WAS handfly I DID NOT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WATCH THE firstofficer south ACTUAL complete OF THE AFTER takeoff FLOW AND checklist.THE TIME between _ feet AND _ feet WHEN WE receive THE ALARM WAS VERY BUSY.THE firstofficer HAD _ opportunity TO CORRECT THE problem _ flow AND _ SEPARATE checklist pretaxi BEFORE takeoff AND AFTER takeoff.THIS COULD HAVE BEEN prevent AND SHOULD BE correct BY give THE firstofficer MORE train IN THE PROPER us OF flow AND checklist WITH attention TO SWITCH PLACEMENT.
617~AS WE WERE climb AFTER takeoff A STRONG SMELL OF SOMETHING burn fill THE CABIN.MYSELF AND A flightattendant IN THE MIDDLE OF COACH CABIN simultaneous call THE captain TO ALERT THEM OF THE SMELL.THE COCKPIT try sever thing TO ALLEVIATE THE SMELL YET NOTHING seem TO WORK.SINCE THE COCKPIT COULD NOT identify THE problem WE declare AN emergency AND return TO jfk airport.I WAS VERY please WITH THE QUICK react OF THE cabincrew AND THE posit FEEDBACK FROM THE COCKPIT.communicate WAS KEY AND IT work.WHEN WE return TO jfk airport THE aircraft WAS quick take OTS.I M veryconfident IN MY coworker AFTER THIS EVENT._ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ THE report state THAT THE CREW DID NOT HAVE TO PREPARE THE passenger FOR AN evacuate AS THE captain TOLD THEM IT WAS TO BE A NORMAL land.THERE WERE NO unusual UPSET passenger MOST TOOK IT IN STRIDE.THE PLANE WAS take OTS FOR maintain.
618~I WAS clear BY groundcontrol TO TAXI TO runway _ BUT I mistake THOUGHT I WAS clear TO backtaxi ON runway _ PRIOR TO takeoff AND SO I enter THE runway WITHOUT properclearance.THERE WAS NO OTHER aircraft IN THE AIR IN THE controlzone AT THE TIME SO THERE WAS NO potentialconflict.THE toweroperator advise ME OF MY ERROR AS I WAS backtaxi.HOW THE problem arise I taxi FROM THE HANGAR RAMP TO taxiway A AND stop THERE TO CALL groundcontrol FOR MY instrumentflightrulesclearance.THIS IS MY homebase AND I FOLLOW THIS procedure _ TO getaway FROM THE HANGAR office BECAUSE OF MY noise aircraft _ AM THEN VISIBLE FROM THE tower.IN THIS INSTANCE THERE WAS A NEW TO ME VOICE work BOTH ground AND tower frequency.I receive MY instrumentflightrulesclearance AND WAS set UP MY radio transpond AND have A LITTLE TROUBLE get THE GPS WAYPOINT WHEN I hear BUT MISINTERPED THE taxiclearance.I AM WELL AWARE THAT A clearance TO A runway doe NOT MEAN YOU CAN CROSS IT OR ENTER IT WITHOUT ANOTHER properclearance.MY percept AND perform WAS WRONG AND I THINK MY MIND WAS preoccupy BY MY avionic WHEN I SHOULD HAVE BEEN listen.I DO NOT THINK THAT I readback THE taxiclearance.
619~ON january _ AT approximate _ MY PLANE AND ANOTHER CAME relative CLOSE TO on ANOTHER.I WAS fly A MOONEY AND THE OTHER traffic WAS A HIGH WING CESSNA THAT appear TO BE OF THE _ OR _ FAMILY OF model.THE OTHER PLANE converge ON ME FROM THE right SIDE.WHEN I DID NOTICE HIM HE WAS approximate _ feet TO MY right AND _ feet BELOW.AT THIS POINT WE WERE near ABEAM EACH OTHER AND THE OTHER PLANE bank toward ME AND pass BEHIND.I pitch UP TO MAKE SURE HE DIDN T HIT ME AS HE bank.contribute factor WERE AS follow NEITHER PLANE HAD strobelight ON.THE CESSNA WAS low THUS hi navigate light WERE mix IN WITH ALL THE light OF THE DENVER area.IT WAS DUSK SO navigate light AREN T AS APPARENT AS AT NIGHT AND aircraft ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO PICK OUT AGAINST A darken SKY.I WAS fly SOLO AND WAS STILL monitor CENTENNIAL tower SO I HAD LITTLE TO DISTRACT MY attention FROM look OUTSIDE.THE onlysuggestion I HAVE FOR great safe IN THE FUTURE IS TO REQUIRE strobelight AT time SUCH AS THIS WITHIN A CERTAIN proximity OF METRO area DURING time OF dark.AS I WAS ON _ mile FINAL FOR land AT JEFFCO airport traffic WATCH aircraft ask tower FOR MY number indicate THAT HE HAD follow ME FROM THE POINT OF NEAR MISS SO apparent HE WAS THE OTHER aircraft.
620~THIS WAS A CLASSIC SIT THAT happen HERE AT prc airport.THE BONANZA pilot LATER write TO US TO OPEN A DIALOGUE.instrumentflightrules BONANZA X ON A crosscountry choose prc airport AS AN INTERMEDIATE destinate.UNFAMILIAR WITH THE AREA HE ask FOR THE instrumentlandingsystem approach.DUE TO WORKLOAD consider AND equip limit ZAB doe NOT PROVIDE service FOR PRACTICE approach OR instrumentflightrules ARRS.PER NORMAL standardoperatingprocedure THE BONANZA WAS clear FOR THE approach AND change TO prc airport.ON initialcontact traffic WAS exchange between THE _ aircraft.THE CESSNA Y report THE BONANZA IN SIGHT AND THE assume WAS MADE BY THE BONANZA pilot THAT THE CESSNA WOULD EXECUTE THE approach AFTER THE BONANZA.INSTEAD THE CESSNA precede THE BONANZA ON THE DRK _ degree RADIAL FOR THE transit.AS THE BONANZA BECAME establish ON THE RADIAL HE observe THE CESSNA.HE WAS ALSO AWARE THAT THE _ degree RADIAL IS ALSO airway.HE observe THE CESSNA CONTINUE eastbound ACROSS THE locate SO assume HE WAS ON airway.HE THEN WENT HEAD DOWN TO transit TO THE locate COURSE.AS HE bring hi HEAD UP FOR THE SCAN THE CESSNA cross right TO left direct IN FRONT attempt TO CAPTURE THE locate.THE BONANZA pilot feel THAT THE instructorpilot OR ZAB OR prc airport SHOULD HAVE help.WITHOUT RADAR DISPLAY WE CAN T HELP AND ZAB CAN T DUE TO DISPLAY constraint.
621~CHAIN OF event I WAS THE firstofficer train sit IN THE rightseat captain WAS IN leftseat.airtrafficcontrol assign US AN altitude OF flightlevel WHICH WAS SET IN THE DINGER.WE WERE preoccupy talk ABOUT A previousflight SIT WHEN THE DINGER WENT OFF AT flightlevel.BEFORE WE know IT WE pass flightlevel TO flightlevel brief AND WE immediate GOT BACK DOWN TO flightlevel.THIS SET OFF A trafficalertandcollisionavoidancesystem _ IN AN airline WHICH WE WERE TOLD BY airtrafficcontrol WHICH HAD TO DEVIATE it head.THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT WAS the distract OF OUR converse.IT WAS NOT intent AND WILL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.

797~I WAS inform TODAY february _ AT _ hour THAT THE oilquantity problem I work ON AND defer ON february _ WAS NO FIX nofly AND I WANT TO report THIS EVENT.I WAS UNAWARE OF THE CONDITION AND WAS NOT inform BY THE crewchief OR TECHNICIAN service WHO WE WERE IN CONTACT WITH ABOUT THE problem.
798~JUST AFTER I D arm MY door I notice A flightattendant move UP THE left SIDE OF THE PLANE AND THEN ANOTHER flightattendant call ME ON THE INTERPHONE.SHE TOLD ME THERE WAS SMOKE IN THE runway lavatory AND THAT THE INTERPHONE WAS BUSY TO THE COCKPIT SO ANOTHER flightattendant WAS go TO THE COCKPIT TO STOP PUSHBACK AND GET assist.I LEFT MY DOOR AS THERE WAS ONLY _ flightattendant IN THE AFT GALLEY.I GOT THE HALON FROM THE runway DOOR AREA AND AFTER see AND smell SMOKE fire IT INTO THE lavatory TRASH contain.THE flightattendant IN THE GALLEY AREA TOLD ME THAT GALLEY liquid HAD NOT stop THE SMOKE.AFTER us THE HALON I return TO MY door AT runway AS A pilot AND OTHER flightattendant HAD reach THE AREA.THE pilot open THE COMPARTMENT AND WAS satisfy THE problem WAS solve AND THE flight continue uneventful.PRIOR TO smell SMOKE IN THE lavatory A flightattendant HAD smell TOBACCO SMOKE ON A passenger exit THE lavatory DURING board.HOWEVER ANOTHER passenger enter THE lavatory obstruct THE VIEW SO SHE WAS UNABLE TO identify THE PERSON.THE great difficult WITH THIS INCIDENT WAS THE inable TO CONTACT THE COCKPIT quick.THE PHONE system ON THE _ ONLY allow FOR on AT A TIME converse UNLIKE OTHER OF OUR AIRLINE south phone WHICH HAVE A partyline.WITH ani OTHER PLANE AT AIRLINE X THE AFT flightattendant COULD HAVE RUNG _ chime THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE PLANE AND ALL flightattendant WOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE of the situate AS WELL AS THE COCKPIT.on flightattendant WOULD HAVE remain ON THE INTERPHONE WHILE ANOTHER WOULD HAVE FOUGHT WHAT WE believe WAS A FIRE.THEN I WOULD NOT HAVE LEFT MY DOOR.BUT BECAUSE THERE WAS ONLY on flightattendant AT THE problem AND IT appear TO BE A FIRE I THOUGHT IT BEST TO LEAVE MY DOOR AND GO AFT.THIS WASN T AN EASY DECISION AS MY DOOR AREA WAS LEFT UNATTENDED.I BELIEVE THE interphonesystem ON THE _ IS A safetyhazard._ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ THE report state THAT THE SMOKE ALARM NEVER sound NOR DID THE TRASH BIN fireextinguisher ACTIVATE.THE SMOKE IN THE lavatory WAS THICK ENOUGH THAT on COULD NOT SEE ONESELF IN THE MIRROR.IT WAS THE reliefpilot WHO CAME BACK AND pull THE TRASH contain OUT TO MAKE SURE THE FIRE WAS OUT.THEY DIDN T SEE ani char remain OF A FIRE.THE report say THAT THERE IS NO OVERRIDE ON THE communicate system EITHER TO THE COCKPIT OR TO THE PURSER.ON ALL THE OTHER type OF aircraft IN THEIR FLEET _ chime signal THE COCKPIT AND OTHER flightattendant OF AN IMMEDIATE emergency.THE INTERCOM ON THE _ DOESN T ALLOW FOR THIS SO THE call FROM THE CABIN ARE QUEUED UP ON THE pilot south SCREEN AND answer BY THEM IN THE ORDER receive.THE report believe THAT THEY WERE luck IN this situate WHERE flightattendant HAD TO LEAVE THEIR door UNATTENDED THAT THEY DIDN T HAVE A passenger initiate evacuate.IN add TO NOT have AN OVERRIDE FOR call THE captain WHEN THE flightattendant ARM THEIR door THEY ARE suppose TO CALL THE PURSER AND NOTIFY HER HIM THAT THE door ARE arm.THEY CAN T DO THIS BECAUSE THE phoneline IS BUSY.consequent THE flightattendant HAVE resort TO announce OVER THE PA THAT THEIR INDIVIDUAL DOOR IS arm.
799~DURING approach TO MBJ _ JAMAICA AT flightlevel KINGSTON center assign A descend TO _ feet.short THEREAFTER A clearance WAS give TO PROCEED AND descend TO MBJ bywayof THE GONIS arrive EXPECT veryhighfrequencyomnidirectionalradiorange _ approach.THE clearance WAS readback exact THAT WAY.AT _ distancemeasuringequipment THE aircraft WAS turn _ degree TO BE establish ON THE _ distancemeasuringequipmentarc AND A descend WAS start TO _ feet AS PER THE GONIS arrive.KINGSTON hand control OF THE aircraft OFF TO SANGSTER approach MBJ WHO immediate ask OUR altitude.AFTER repeat WHAT WE HAD interpret AS OUR instruct THE control advise THAT WE HAD NOT BEEN clear TO _ feet.THE flight continue TO MBJ AND land WITHOUT INCIDENT.THERE WAS NO conflictingtraffic IN THE AREA AT THE TIME.THE LANGUAGE OF THE control WAS A LARGE FACTOR IN understand WHAT THE clearance actual WAS.
800~INBOUND TO lga airport ON standardterminalarrivalroute WE WERE _ feet HIGH AT MARRC cross restrict OF _ feet.THE flightmanagementsystem increase power TOO SOON balloon US JUST PRIOR TO THE FIX.I disconnect THE autopilot.BUT STILL COULDN T BE exact AT _ feet BUT GOT ALMOST TO _ feet BY MARRC.
801~number _ engine IGNITER PLUG CHANGE ON AN a5 check.I possible receive THE WRONG IGNITER plug IN THE part KIT AND install THEM ON number _ engine.THE engine HAD START problem.THE plug WERE change AGAIN AND engine start OK.
802~A _ visualflightrules LYH TO LZU DUE OVER BZM AT _.flight PLAN show trueairspeed OF _ knot.bring TO supervise south attention.call gso airport approach WHEN aircraft WAS OVERDUE.gso airport DIDN T KNOW WHERE HE WAS.inform supervise.supervise say WE DON T WORRY ABOUT visualflightrules south.TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE center HAVE searchandrescue responsible TO visualflightrulesaircraft ON flight follow.I BELIEVE THE supervise WAS preoccupy WITH AN operatorerror THAT HAD JUST happen ON ANOTHER SECTOR.
803~aircraft X flightlevel aircraft Y flightlevel WERE approve FROM handoff SECTOR AT wrongaltitude FOR direct OF flight.aircraft X WAS vector FOR climb aircraft AND descend TO flightlevel.aircraft Y WAS vector _ degree left FOR climb traffic.jball electron place _ mile RING AROUND aircraft concern WAS us ON aircraft X FOR separate WITH climb traffic AND ALSO FOR POTENTIAL conflictingtraffic cross rout OF flight.aircraft X WAS issue right TURN FOR traffic AT flightlevel AND give descend TO flightlevel.aircraft Y WAS give left TURN TO _ degree FOR A climb.aircraft Y DID NOT TAKE THE head AND question assignedheading.aircraft Y THEN issue A left TURN TO _ degree.separate WAS LOST BECAUSE TOO MUCH attention WAS pay TO sever aircraft cross aircraft X AND aircraft Y rout OF flight AT flightlevel.THIS occur WAS precede BY A week quickturnaround.THAT IS leave WORK AT _ PM THE previousevening AND have TO BE AT WORK NO LESS THAN _ AM ACTUAL signin TIME _ AM.THIS IS AN assign SHIFT ON A week BASIS.
804~WE CAME OUT OF _ line OF weather NEAR THE bunt intersect WHILE transit FROM ZNY TO phl airport approachcontrol.DUE TO A highcockpitworkload WE DID NOT CATCH THAT phl airport WAS land runway RATHER THAN THE USUAL runway ON THE aircraftcommunicationsaddressingandreportingsystem automaticterminalinformationservice.WE brief AND setup FOR THE instrumentlandingsystem TO runway.WE WERE give numerousvectors WHICH conclude WITH A TURN TO _ degree TO INTERCEPT THE locate.short THEREAFTER WE WERE clear FOR THE approach.I DO NOT RECALL THAT THE control specify instrumentlandingsystemrunway.HE THEN TOLD US TO CONTACT THE tower AT THE mark.WE call THE tower AT SPEEZ intersect.THE tower say number _ CONTINUE.tower THEN clear US TO LAND WHEN WE WERE AT _ feet.WE land ON runway taxi clear AND WENT TO THE GATE.WE GOT A MESSAGE TO CALL THE tower BY PHONE.THERE WAS NO trafficconflict.OUR USUAL land runway IN phl airport IS runway.VERY simple PUT NEITHER WE NOR THE control CAUGHT THAT WE WERE line UP FOR AND land ON THE wrongrunway.supplementalinformation FROM airborneclassificationnumber _ WE setup COCKPIT AND brief THE runway approach AND follow IT DOWN ON locate OR autopilot TO land.WE WERE clear BY approach TO FLY _ degree TO INTERCEPT THE locate.short AFTER WE GOT clear FOR THE instrumentlandingsystem TO THE BEST I CAN REMEMBER HE DID NOT SAY WHICH runway.WE WERE TOLD TO contacttower OVER mark AND AGAIN HE DID NOT GIVE US THE NAME BECAUSE I look AT approach PLATE TO MAKE SURE IT WAS SPEEZ intersect.WHEN WE check IN ALL tower say WAS number _ AND TO CONTINUE approach.AT _ feet WE WERE clear TO LAND AND I DO NOT REMEMBER IF HE say runway OR JUST clear TO LAND.WE land ON runway WITH NO trafficconflict AND proceed TO GATE.THE bottomline IS WE DID NOT CATCH THE CHANGE IN runway AND approach AND tower DID NOT EITHER BECAUSE WE WERE capture ON THE right SIDE south locate ON autopilot TO _ feetabovegroundlevel.
805~captain AND firstofficer misidentify FIRST AID KIT FOR medicalkit.ON THE aircraft THERE IS _ medicalkit AND _ FIRST AID KIT.WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR check THAT seal ARE INTACT.THE firstofficer duty REQUIRE THIS ON preflight.apparent THERE WERE _ FIRST AID kit INSTEAD OF _ AND _.maintain CAUGHT THIS _ day AFTER MY flight.supplementalinformation FROM airborneclassificationnumber _ BOTH kit ARE SIMILAR IN SIZE AND COLOR.THE ONLY differ IS THE label ON THE FRONT OF THE KIT.
806~locate dfw airport runway.AFTER land runway dfw airport tower instruct US TO us taxiway A AND MONITOR _.WE THEN WERE give instruct TO crossrunway runway AND SNUG UP TO aircraft Y.THEY WERE monitor THE samefrequency WE WERE.WE DID AS tower ask US SO THEY COULD GET AN aircraft ACROSS BEHIND US AND GIVE THEM ENOUGH ROOM TO clear.short THEREAFTER THEY GAVE aircraft Y cross instruct AND aircraft Y us SO MUCH power THAT THE nosegear ON OUR aircraft WAS scrub ON THE ground AND ALMOST CAME OFF THE ground.THEIR aircraft WAS ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE activerunway BEFORE WE COULD EVEN PUSH UP THE throttle.excess IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT.passenger AND flightattendant question WHAT HAD happen AND IF EVERYTHING WAS OK.THIS COULD HAVE BEEN A LOT WORSE IF WE HAD BEEN IN A smalleraircraft.THE tower supervise say HE WAS ALSO go TO followup ON THIS.
807~approachcontrol clear US FOR THE VISUAL ON runway.WHEN hand OFF TO THE localcontroller HE clear US FOR runway.WITH THE CHATTER OF A train environ WITH A copilot IN train AND THE gust weather WE THOUGHT HE HAD clear US FOR runway WHICH IS WHAT WE land ON.
808~I approach THE _ ON AN instrument clearance expect TO us THE hwd airport locate distancemeasuringequipment runway AS A mean OF descend THROUGH A POSSIBLE broke LAYER AS report BY hwd airport automaticterminalinformationservice.BAY approach WAS BUSY AND keep ME ON A _ degree head AFTER cross SUNOL FROM THE east ON airway.WHEN I COULD SEE THAT cloud WOULD NOT BE A FACTOR I TOLD approach THAT I WAS prepare TO CANCEL BUT WOULD STICK WITH THEM UNTIL I COULD descend MORE.I cancel AT THE SHORELINE AT _ feetmeansealevel AND TOLD THE control I WOULD GO DIRECT SQL.IT WAS AT THIS POINT THAT I MADE MY firstmistake.I THOUGHT THAT THE SAN MATEO BRIDGE WAS THE DUMBARTON BRIDGE.I MADE A BRIEF LEG ALONG THE COAST TOWARD THE BRIDGE AND call SQL tower incorrect report posit.MY instruct WERE THE STANDARD A right baseentry TO runway _ SQL report CEMENT PLANT.I head FOR THE LAST VISUAL MATCH TO SEAPORT boulevard AND THE CEMENT PLANT AS I cross THE BAY.MY precis MIGHT HAVE ALSO BEEN affect BY A passenger THAT WAS try TO SPOT THE airport AND ask question ABOUT THE runwaylayout AND BEACON.NEITHER OF US spot THE BEACON.AS I approach THE west SHORE OF THE BAY I realize THAT I WAS look AT A SMALL HILL IT WAS NOT THE CEMENT PLANT.scan FOR THE airport I look TO MY right AND SAW THE sfo airport approach light.AT THAT POINT I understand exact WHAT HAD happen.I call SQL tower AFTER make A TURN direct AWAY FROM sfo airport.I ESTIMATE THAT I COULD HAVE BEEN _ TO _ nauticalmile FROM sfo airport AT THE close.MY altitude WAS _ feetmeansealevel AT THAT TIME.SQL tower say THAT THEY DID NOT SEE ME ON RADAR AND ask ME TO identify.WHEN I DID THE control TOLD ME TO MAKE AN IMMEDIATE right TURN AND THAT I WAS IN THE classb.AT THAT POINT I WAS ABEAM BAY meadow.I MADE A STANDARD ENTRY FROM BAY meadow.ON THE ground SQL TOLD ME TO CALL sfo airport tower.I DID SO short AFTER land.THE sfo airport tower supervise WAS VERY reason AND MADE SOME comment THAT THE READER MIGHT FIND RELEVANT.FIRST MY INCURSION HAD occur DURING AN unusual QUIET TIME SO I DID NOT SEE ani traffic land AT sfo airport TO ALERT ME TO MY incorrectposition.ALSO towerpersonnel WERE watch ME approach AND GOT CLOSE TO call OFF THE FIRST approach TO sfo airport DURING THAT TIME.IF THEY HAD DONE SO THEY WOULD HAVE escalate THE MATTER BUT DID NOT BECAUSE THERE HAD NOT BEEN ani consequence apparent THEY WERE satisfy WITH THE SIT AND safe OF THE pend approach WHEN THEY SAW ME TURN AWAY FROM sfo airport.I FEEL THAT I WOULD NOT HAVE MADE THIS MISTAKE IF I HAD continue THE approach TO hwd airport AND cancel ONLY AFTER turn ONTO THE locate AND go PAST A FEW stepdowns.THE made up ENTRANCE OVER THE BAY couple WITH LACK OF DAYTIME visual WAS A FIRST FOR ME.WITHOUT A passenger I MIGHT HAVE CAUGHT THE ERROR A LITTLE soon.
809~THIS IS JUST A GENERAL NOTICE.FOR WHATEVER reason AIRLINE IS consist dispatch _ intern FLTS WITH VERY lowfuel OVER destinate.THIS problem seem TO HAVE AGAIN CREPT INTO THE DISPATCH system.IN on INSTANCE WE WERE dispatch FROM mia airport TO POP ON flight WITH AN UNACCEPTABLE fuelload.fortunate THE captain HAD _ pound add.BECAUSE OF poorairtrafficcontrol procedure WE waive OFF A VISUAL approach reenter THE PATTERN AND land.EVEN AFTER add FUEL on SIMPLE goaraound HAD US LAND WITH LESS THAN origin DISPATCH FUEL OVER destinate.IT IS NOT UNCOMMON TO HAVE TO EXECUTE A nonprecision veryhighfrequencyomnidirectionalradiorange approach WHICH WOULD HAVE PUT US IN A WORSE PREDICAMENT.AS A MATTER OF FACT approachcontrol plan ON US fly FROM THE northwest TO crossover southeastbound TO PERFORM A nonprecision instrument approach.THERE WERE NO enroute deviate OR problem TO BLAME FOR additionalfuel BURN.FROM WHAT I CAN REMEMBER passenger AND cargoload WERE NOT factor EITHER.IF safe IS A PRIORITY IT WOULD BE advise TO NOT LEAD OUR crew INTO A danger lowfuel CRISIS WITH FEW option IN THE CARIBBEAN.THE save OF A FEW PENNIES IS great outweigh BY THE LOSS OF BIG dollar AS A RESULT OF FUEL divers AND WORSE LOSS OF live AND aircraft.A FEW thing TO THINK ABOUT WHEN DISPATCH decide ON A fuelload WOULD BE _ HOW rely IS weatherreporting AND forecast IN THESE THIRD WORLD location._ NO MATTER HOW rely THE report IS HOW FAST CAN THE weather CHANGE._ IF weigh IS NOT A problem WHY DISPATCH FOR PENNY save RATHER THAN FOR safe AND rely.THE ABOVE EXAMPLE give A goodreason TO LOOK INTO DISPATCH procedure AND DETERMINE WHY aircraft ARE be dispatch WITH FAR TOO LOW OF A fuelload._ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ THE firstofficer report call BACK AND say THAT HE HAD feel THE fuelreserve WERE ON THE LIGHT SIDE AND want THE COMPANY TO HAVE A headsup ON THIS ISSUE.HE WAS do MOST OF hi fly THAT MONTH OUT OF MIAMI.SINCE THEN HE HAS NOT note ani FURTHER FUEL anomaly.THE plan FUEL IS ABOUT _ pound FOR land.THE firstofficer feel THE FUEL load WERE LEGAL BUT CLOSE TO low margin.HE WAS GLAD THIS on captain HAD add THE EXTRA _ pound.THE COMPANY respond TO HIM AND say THAT THEIR FUEL load ARE base UPON historic DATA WITH THE currentcondition assess FOR THE FINAL fuelload.
810~I WAS travel ON AN instrumentflight PLAN FROM dca airport TO hpn airport.PRIOR TO reach breeze NY approach clear ME DIRECT _.I WAS concern THAT THE DIRECT hpn airport clearance WAS set UP FOR A VISUAL approach AND land THAT MIGHT NOT BE full OR true VISUAL AS I WAS STILL ABOVE A VERY THICK ground LAYER WITH ONLY occasion groundcontact.I request THE instrumentlandingsystemrunway _ AND NEW YORK instruct ME TO descend AND MAINTAIN _ feet AND vector ME TO THE north TO INTERCEPT.AFTER _ MORE VECTOR NEW YORK clear ME FOR THE instrumentlandingsystemrunway _ approach.I intercept AND turn INBOUND WITH GPS indicate ABOUT _ distancemeasuringequipment FROM hpn airport.NEW YORK DID NOT HAND ME OFF TO tower AS NEW YORK WAS handle _ addition inbound ON THE instrumentlandingsystemrunway _ AN aircraft flight AND A businessjet.NEW YORK THEN instruct THE aircraft flight WHICH HAD BEEN clear ON THE instrumentlandingsystemrunway _ TO OVERTAKE ME ON THE approach.I WAS STILL do THE MENTAL MATH TO ESTIMATE THE POINT AT WHICH AN approximate _ knot aircraft WOULD OVERTAKE MY _ knot approach speed AND IF I WOULD HAVE intercept glideslope YET WHEN THE aircraft flight question THE NEW YORK instruct TO OVERTAKE THE CESSNA ON approach.I WAS quit relieve TO HEAR THE aircraft flight QUESTION THE control south instruct.NEW YORK ask aircraft IF HE want THE CESSNA TO DO A _ degree TURN TO WHICH aircraft reply THAT THAT WAS NEW YORK south DECISION AND FUNCTION.NEW YORK THEN instruct ME TO DO A left _ TO ALLOW BOTH jet TO PASS AND THEN REINTERCEPT THE instrumentlandingsystem.I begin THE _ degree TURN AND HAD visualcontact WITH THE _ INBOUND jet DURING THE LAST _ degree OF THE TURN.NEW YORK hand THE _ jet OFF TO tower AND clear ME TO REINTERCEPT.I reestablish ON THE instrumentlandingsystem WAS hand OFF TO tower AND land WITHOUT INCIDENT.MY concern ABOUT THIS center ON _ establish AND maintain verticalseparation WITH AN aircraft THAT I COULD NOT SEE DUE TO it posit BEHIND AND ABOVE ME._ assume NON collide verticalseparation I ESTIMATE THAT I WOULD HAVE BEEN LESS THAN _ feet BELOW THE aircraftjet flight fly THE samelocation centerline WHICH WOULD EXPOSE MY _ TO potential sever waketurbulence._ THE expect demonstrate BY NEW YORK approach look FOR aircraft IN instrumentflightrulesflight TO PROCEED visual WHILE ON AN instrument approach._ THE POTENTIAL FOR limitedvisibility IN cloud FOG WITHIN A FEW mile OF MY posit._ MY reluctant TO QUESTION AN airtrafficcontrolinstruction DESPITE PALPABLE DISCOMFORT.IN term OF correctiveaction _ I NEED TO MORE ready QUESTION AN airtrafficcontrolinstruction WITH WHICH I AM NOT comfort AS pilotincommand._ airtrafficcontrol need TO THINK TWICE BEFORE instruct TO OVERTAKE ON approach ARE give TO A LARGE aircraft overtake A small on DURING AN instrumentlandingsystem approach WHEN on IS ON glideslope AND THE OTHER IS rapid approach IT._ commend FOR THE aircraftcrew south question OF THE instruct THEREBY help TO ENSURE A SAFE approach AND land FOR ALL _ aircraft.
811~I WAS fly AN AEROBATIC SEQUENCE IN BORREGO south waiver BOX.I WAS monitor _ WHILE IN THE BOX.AFTER complete THE SEQUENCE I exit THE BOX AT _ feetabovegroundlevel switch TO aeronauticaladvisorystation ON _ AND hear THE CESSNA _ report DOWNWIND FOR runway _.I report OVERHEAD THE FIELD OUTBOUND FOR A _ degree ENTRY.I proceed OUTBOUND FOR approximate _ second AND MADE _ degree TURN TO THE _ degree.I report _ degree INBOUND AND receive NO respond FROM THE _.I WAS look DOWNWIND BASE AND FINAL search FOR THE _.I HAD NO CONTACT.I THEN turn TO DOWNWIND AT MIDFIELD AND _ feetabovegroundlevel AND transmit THAT I WAS turn DOWNWIND AND ask THE _ WHERE HE WAS.AT THIS TIME THE _ transmit THAT I HAD JUST CUT HIM OFF.BOTH OF US proceed TO MAKE NORMAL land.I precede THE _ SINCE I WAS ALREADY IN FRONT AND apologize FOR cut IN FRONT.AT NO TIME DID I HAVE visualcontact WITH THE _.fortunate THERE WAS NO MIDAIR between OUR aircraft.IN review THIS INCIDENT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN search UPWIND FOR THIS traffic.I HAD assume THAT WHEN HE report DOWNWIND THAT HE WAS rough MIDFIELD.THE _ pilot COULD HAVE MADE A STANDARD _ degree ENTRY TO THE PATTERN INSTEAD OF THE NONSTANDARD DOWNWIND ENTRY.HE COULD HAVE BEEN MORE EXPLICIT AS TO WHERE HE WAS ON THE DOWNWIND.HE admit THAT HE HAD hear MY transmit AND COULD HAVE state WHERE HE WAS WHEN I report INBOUND ON THE _ degree AND HE DIDN T HAVE ME IN SIGHT.final THERE COULD WELL HAVE BEEN A HIGH WING low SIT THAT MADE IT DIFFICULT FOR EITHER OF US TO SEE THE OTHER.THE SIT COULD HAVE BEEN eliminate HAD THE _ fly A standardpattern ENTRY OR BOTH OF US do A betterjob OF communicate OUR posit WHEN NEITHER OF US HAD THE OTHER IN SIGHT.

818~WHEN I arrive AT aircraft I note THAT THERE WERE _ minimumequipmentlist south ON THE LOGBOOK left FORWARD boostpump AND left FUEL GAUGE.I READ THE minimumequipmentlist FOR THE boostpump AND THEN THE minimumequipmentlist.THE FIRST fail TO MENTION THAT YOU CAN T HAVE BOTH AND IN MY hast I fail TO NOTE THAT THE FUEL GAUGE minimumequipmentlist clear state THAT BOTH boostpump MUST BE operate.THERE real IS NO EXCUSE FOR miss THIS BUT factor involve WERE rush TO MEET THE on time depart AND think THAT BOTH maintain AND DISPATCH HAVE give THEIR approve FOR THE RELEASE.I WILL TAKE THE TIME TO READ NOT SCAN ALL minimumequipmentlist south.WITHOUT A DOUBT I SHOULD HAVE CAUGHT IT AND I WILL IN THE FUTURE.WHEN WE arrive AT OUR destinate maintain meet THE aircraft inform ME THAT IT HAD BEEN release WITH AN ILLEGAL minimumequipmentlist apologize AND ground THE PLANE.DISPATCH ALSO call TO apology FOR NOT catch THE problem.DON T RUSH.THE flight WAS conduct WITH NO incident.supplementalinformation FROM airborneclassificationnumber _ fuelquantity indicate minimumequipmentlist IS quit COMMON AND THIS MAY HAVE add TO complacent.
819~descend INTO BOSTON WE GOT A clearance TO HOLD AT pvd airport veryhighfrequencyomnidirectionalradiorange AS publish.THE barometricpressure WAS fall rapid AND WE WERE clear TO descend southwest OF pvd airport TO CROSS AT OR BELOW _ feet AND MAINTAIN _ feet THEN CHANGE TO _ feet.WE ALSO WERE try TO PLUG THE holdingpattern INTO THE GPS BUT COULDN T GET IT IN THE BOX.UPON reach _ feet WE realize WE HADN T RESET THE ALTIMETER.I BELIEVE IT WAS approximate _ WE stop THE descend AT _ feet WENT _ feet BELOW _ feet AND climb backup TO _ feet RIGHT AWAY.look AT OUR trafficalertandcollisionavoidancesystem _ WE FOUND NO CONFLICT.I BELIEVE nexttime on WILL WORK RADIO AND THE GPS AND THE pilotflying WILL ONLY FLY THE AIRPLANE IE control autopilot AND SET altimeter.
820~AT NIGHT WE WERE get vector TO A DOWNWIND TO runway _ PIT.ABEAM THE number WE WERE TOLD TO KEEP speedup.be normal HIGH _ feet THIS WAS NOT UNUSUAL.IT IS typic FOR approach TO KEEP US HIGH BUT EXTEND OUR DOWNWIND AT LEAST PAST THE outermarker.SO THIS IS THE SIT _ feet _ knot.realize THE capability OF THIS aircraft _ IT IS usual NOT A BIG DEAL TO ACCEPT VISUAL AT ABOUT _ mile FROM touchdownzoneelevation.BUT THAT NIGHT WE WERE ask TO TURN left BASE AROUND _ mile THEN WE WERE give clearance TO descend TO _ feet.give THE combine OF speed altitude ABOUT _ feet high THAN USUAL AND THE FACT IT WAS AT NIGHT GAVE US A HAND FULL OF WORK.captain AND I WERE BOTH try TO SLOW aircraft CONFIGURE IN prepare TO LAND AND PIT HAS low dim runwaylight.NEITHER OF US HAD realize THAT thing WERE TOO FAST FOR US TO ACCEPT approach.RESULT WAS we i GOT disorient end UP ABOUT _ dot AWAY FROM centerline AND LOW ON glidepath.groundproximitywarningsystem activate AT WHICH TIME I HAD realize I WAS NOT ON COURSE TOO LOW.I BELIEVE ALL THIS COULD HAVE BEEN avoid IF WE WERE MORE concentrate ON OUTSIDE fly THAN try TO SLOW descend AND COMPLY WITH checklist ALL AT ONCE.nexttime I WILL BE caution ABOUT accept THIS TYPE OF approach know THAT OR keep IN MIND altitude speed.AT NIGHT THAT make IT MUCH TOUGHER.
821~DURING taxiout AT stl airport WE WERE give instruct TO TAXI TO runway bywayof taxiway D AND taxiway C TO crossrunway runway AND HOLD SHORT OF runway.AS THE NOSE OF THE aircraft cross THE HOLD SHORT LINE OF runway ABOUT _ feet WE WERE give NEW instruct TO STOP immediate.THERE WAS A _ IN posit ON runway BUT HAD NOT BEEN give takeoff instruct BECAUSE THERE WERE aircraft cross runway DOWN AT taxiway right AND taxiway south THAT HAD land ON runway.THERE WERE sever aircraft WITH SIMILAR clearance THAT HAD change sever time.THIS lead TO SOME confuse ON OUR PART.
822~AFTER land ON runway IN ewr airport WE WERE hold SHORT between runway AND runway.tower clear A _ flight BXA TO crossrunway runway AND contactground.WE WERE operate flight GXA AND THOUGHT WE WERE give clearance TO CROSS THE runway.WE proceed TO crossrunway runway AND AT THE sametime ANOTHER aircraft WAS clear TO LAND AND WAS TOLD TO goaraound BECAUSE OF THE CLOSE proximity.AFTER discuss THE INCIDENT WITH ewr airport tower supervise NO FURTHER ACTION WILL BE take.I BELIEVE THE close OF THE _ callsign contribute TO THE MISCOM.
823~I WAS distract fly THE aircraft deviate AROUND thunderstormcell.hear A clearance BY airtrafficcontrol.firstofficer readback AN altitude CHANGE AND WE begin descend.airtrafficcontrol query US AND WE correct FOR altitude.NO FURTHER INCIDENT occur.weather WAS A FACTOR.IT HAD BEEN A longday.THE firstofficer WAS lowtime.BOTH pilot WERE A LITTLE tire.supplementalinformation FROM airborneclassificationnumber _ apparent IT WAS FOR ANOTHER CARRIER THAT HAD A SIMILAR sound flightnumber.

938~AT approximate _ ON april _ I WAS _ mile OUT ON A _ degree head clear FOR A STRAIGHT IN land TO runway _ AT _ EXECUTIVE TMB BY THE tower control.FROM THAT direct AND altitude OF _ feet THE runway appear TO BE A PERIMETER ROAD AND THE taxiway design D DELTA appear TO BE MUCH wide AND MORE LIKE A runway.I start TO MAKE MY approach TO THE taxiway.CLOSE TO THE taxiway I notice THERE WERE NO number AT THE approach END AND initiate A goaraound.LATER THE tower instruct ME TO goaraound.AFTER THE goaraound AND AT THE approach END OF runway _ I COULD SEE WHY I mistake IT FOR A PERIMETER DRIVE.THERE IS A dark ASPHALT STRIPE ABOUT THE SIZE OF A NARROW ROAD DOWN THE center OF THE runway AND THE REST OF THE pave IS MUCH GRAYER AND IS NOT THAT MUCH differ appear THAN THE ADJACENT SOIL.THE condition AT THE TIME WERE goodvisualflightrules.I FEEL THAT IF A pilot WITH OVER _ hour COULD MAKE THIS MISTAKE IN goodweather WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN WITH poorvisibility AND lowexperience.I THINK THAT AVIATION need A STANDARD mark system LIKE WHITE border ON runway SIMILAR TO THE WAY SOME ASPHALT road ARE mark.THIS I FEEL WOULD PROVIDE A clear PICTURE OF THE runway FROM A DISTANCE.MY COLOR VISION IS GOOD AND ACUITY IS correct TO _.
939~DVD player IN firstclass CAN T BE override BY PA.I WAS inform BY A flightattendant OF A safetyproblem ON _ aircraft equip IN firstclass CABIN WITH DVD person entertain device.THE AUDIO CHANNEL OF THESE device IS NOT rout THROUGH THE aircraft AUDIO system AND AS SUCH ARE NOT override BY THE PA system WHEN IN us.couple WITH THE us OF THE NOISE cancel headset THE passenger IN firstclass OFTEN SIT OBLIVIOUS TO safe AND OTHER PA announcement.AS THE DVD south ARE STAND ALONE unit I DOUBT THEY undergo stc airport certificate.HAD THEY BEEN require TO BE consider AS INTEGRAL THE federalaviationregulation WOULD REQUIRE THEY BE override LIKE THE NORMAL AUDIO CHANNEL.THIS MAY BE A regulate OVERSIGHT BUT IT STILL leave A SERIOUS safe GAP SHOULD TIME critic inform NEED TO BE pass BY PA.I RECOMMEND THAT THE DVD player BE WITHHELD FROM FURTHER serve UNTIL A PA OVERRIDE TO BOTH THE DVD AND NOISE cancel headset BE devise AND implement.CABIN crew CANNOT BE expect TO CIRCULATE THROUGH THE CABIN pull headset OFF passenger IN AN emergency.
940~MY firstofficer MADE A COMMENT ABOUT ONLY _ enroute alternate WHILE work ON OUR flight PLAN.I HAD see THAT BEFORE AND DID NOT GIVE IT MUCH consider.WE HAD adequatefuel FOR THE TRIP altern AND RESERVE.ABOUT _ hour INTO THE flight DISPATCH call TO TELL US THAT THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A THIRD enroute altern AND THAT WE need MORE FUEL THAN WE HAD FOR THAT altern.WE HAD TO DIVERT TO anc airport FOR MORE FUEL BEFORE proceed ON TO sjc airport.supplementalinformation FROM airborneclassificationnumber _ receive CALL FROM DISPATCH inform US THAT WE DID NOT HAVE sufficientfuel onboard TO COVER THE nextleg OF TRIP WHICH WAS dispatch WITHOUT A THIRD equaltimepoint.UPON close SCRUTINY DISPATCH realize THAT THE extendedoperations require FOR A THIRD equaltimepoint TO COMPLY WITH THE _ minute RULE HAD NOT BEEN meet.FUEL onboard WHILE MORE THAN ADEQUATE TO REACH destinate WAS _ pound LESS THAN NECESSARY TO PROVIDE FOR AN addition enroute altern AS require BY THE _ minute RULE.NO choose BUT TO DIVERT TO COMPLY WITH PAPER legal.DISPATCH suggest DIVERT TO hnl airport BUT anc airport WAS close SO divert THERE.BETTER check AND balances IN COMPUTER program IS NECESSARY IN THE equaltimepoint determine PROCESS.SOME flightplan HAVE NOT HAD ani EQUAL TIME point calculate._ EQUAL TIME point ARE NOT UNUSUAL AND THAT IS WHY IT WAS NOT CAUGHT BY THE flightcrew.
941~depart runway _ ON _ climbout.AT ABOUT _ distancemeasuringequipment WE WERE instruct TO contactdeparture.ON initialcontact WE WERE instruct TO TURN TO _ degree.I acknowledge BUT depart repeat THE instruct.I acknowledge AGAIN AND STILL depart DID NOT HEAR ME.firstofficer WAS fly AND HAD start THE TURN WITH FIRST instruct.AFTER ANOTHER acknowledge depart final hear ME AND mention hi RADIO WAS cut OUT ON HIM.AS WE continue THE TURN THE flightdirector COMMAND bar ON BOTH attitudedirectorindicator south disappear ALONG WITH THE ROLL annunciate ON BOTH finalmonitoraid south.THE head LIGHT WAS ALSO ON.depart THEN TOLD US TO tight UP THE TURN TO AVOID jfk airport AIRSPACE.WE increase THE BANK AND ABOUT _ minute LATER THE head LIGHT WENT OUT.THE ROLL finalmonitoraid return AS DID THE COMMAND bar.system operate normal FOR THE REST OF THE flight.THE combine OF THE control south RADIO AND THE head problem cause US TO OVERSHOOT THE groundtrack ON climbout.
942~cross restrict OF _ feet AT _ distancemeasuringequipment WAS miss.I us A NOISE CONSCIOUS PROFILE OF reducedpower WITH A VERY heavy AIRPLANE.clean UP THE aircraft DID NOT ALLOW AN ADEQUATE climb RATE I WAS LATE IN recognize THE problem.PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT WE HAD A confront WITH OUR DISPATCH IN RESPECT TO obtain weatherinformation.WE AS A CREW WERE preoccupy WITH THIS DURING preflight TAXI AND takeoff.MY firstofficer NOT A STRONG pilot WAS UNAWARE OF THE standardinstrumentdeparture restrict EVEN THOUGH I mention IT IN discuss OF THE depart.BUT I ONLY mention IT casual.IT WAS THE firsttime WE fly TOGETHER.
943~WE WERE assign TO climb TO _ feet THEN center change assignedaltitude TO _ feet.OUR flightattendant CAME FORWARD AS WE WERE climb THROUGH _ feet AND inform US THAT A passenger WAS us on OF OUR headset TO LISTEN IN ON OUR converse.I TOLD HER TO TELL HIM TO REMOVE THE HEADSET BECAUSE WE DID NOT WANT TO HAVE HIM monitor THE flight.THIS distract cause US TO FLY THROUGH OUR altitude THAT WAS assign BY airtrafficcontrol.AT _ feet airtrafficcontrol ask US WHAT OUR altitude WAS AND WE quick return TO OUR assignedaltitude OF _ feet.IN THE FUTURE WE WILL NOT ALLOW THE flightattendant TO VIOLATE sterilecockpit procedure.supplementalinformation FROM airborneclassificationnumber _.
944~A passenger seat IN maincabin approach THE maincabin flightattendant IN AFT GALLEY AND offer THEM MONEY TO ALLOW HIM TO SMOKE IN LAVATORY.WHEN flightattendant refuse passenger light A CIGARETTE IN hi SEAT.passenger IN THE AREA WERE VERY UPSET AS THE passenger DID NOT SEEM STABLE.AT TIME OF INCIDENT WE WERE OVER THE ATLANTIC.I SPOKE TO THE passenger.HE agree NOT TO CAUSE anymore disrupt.THE passenger pass OUT OR WENT TO SLEEP AND WE land IN ORD WITHOUT FURTHER INCIDENT.WE WERE meet BY lawenforcement IMMIGRATION AND custom official.flightattendant number _ want TO FILE A complain.WE WERE TOLD BECAUSE THE INCIDENT happen OVER intern water IT WOULD NOT DO ani GOOD TO FILE A complain.
945~WE WERE LEVEL AT OUR assignedaltitude OF _ feet AND.
946~DURING CRUISE A hydraulicsystem QUANTITY WAS note TO BE AT ZERO.THERE WAS NO OTHER ABNORMAL indicate.WHEN THE SO bring IT TO MY attention HE mention THAT HE HAD see IT DECREASE A LITTLE BUT THOUGHT IT WAS DUE TO COLD soak.HE ALSO mention THE PUMP lowpressurelight WERE NOT illuminate.WE accomplish ACTION step OF THE hydraulicleak OR LOSS checklist BUT PRIOR TO proceed WITH step WHICH WOULD LEAD US TO A SPECIFIC checklist FOR system A LOSS I call OUR maintenancecoordinator AND dispatch TO DISCUSS THE SIT.AFTER describe THE indication I ask THE maintenancecoordinator IF HE THOUGHT WE HAD A hydraulicfailure.HE say NO HE THOUGHT IT WAS AN error indicate AND THE system WAS OK.I ask HIM A COUPLE OF time IF I understand HIM correct THAT HE THOUGHT THE system HAD NOT fail.HE reply THAT WAS CORRECT.THE dispatch say NOTHING.SOMETHING DID NOT SEEM RIGHT TO ME BUT I say I WOULD CONSIDER THE system TO BE OK UNLESS I call THEM OTHERWISE.WE place ALL hydraulic switch IN THEIR origin posit THUS REPWRING THE A hydraulicsystem.I ask THE SO TO GIVE ME hi procedure BOOK say THIS doe NOT SEEM CORRECT.AFTER read THE procedure A COUPLE OF time ALONG WITH THE follow on condition statement IT BECAME clear THAT WE HAD NO OPTION BUT TO CONSIDER THE A hydraulicsystem TO BE fail AND FOLLOW THE A hydraulicsystem fail procedure.WE reaccomplish THE origin procedure AS WELL AS THE A hydraulicsystem fail procedure.I notify THE maintenancecoordinator AND dispatch OF OUR intent ALSO state WE WOULD DECLARE AN emergency WITH approachcontrol STOP ON THE runway HAVE maintain PIN THE GEAR AND TOW US TO THE GATE.AT THIS TIME THE dispatch state HE agree OUR onlyoption WAS TO CONSIDER THE A hydraulicsystem TO BE fail.I THOUGHT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN help IF HE HAD enter INTO THE discuss early INSTEAD OF be SILENT.WE descend TO A loweraltitude AND slow IN ORDER TO ADHERE TO limit FOR _ YAW DAMPER inoperative.FOR THE approach WE lower THE land GEAR manual AND us AN altern mean OF extend THE flap AND leadingedgedevice.EVERYTHING WENT AS brief.approach land AND TOW IN WERE UNEVENTFUL.WHERE I MADE MY MISTAKE WAS give TOO MUCH import TO THE hydraulic lowpressurelight AND flight control lowpressurelight NOT be illuminate.THAT make NO differ IN THE procedure.WHEN THE QUANTITY drop BELOW _ gallon YOU MUST ASSUME A hydraulicsystem HAS fail OR HAS A LEAK.THIS WAS NOT MY FIRST hydraulicsystemfailure.IF WE HAD ONLY READ THE origin procedure IN it ENTIRETY BEFORE call maintain control I WOULD NOT BE write THIS NOW.
947~WE WERE conduct skydive operate IN A _.THERE WERE SOME cloud be BLOWN IN FROM THE MODERATE tradewinds BUT THERE WERE SOME visualflightrules area.THE FIRST TANDEM skydive jump INTO A LARGE visualflightrules HOLE.THE SECOND TANDEM skydive ALSO want TO JUMP IN THE SAME HOLE.HOWEVER HE HAD A difficulttime get hi passenger TO THE DOOR.consequent WHEN THEY jump THEY WENT THROUGH SOME cloud.INSTEAD OF wait FOR ME TO MAKE A CIRCLE AND REALIGN THE AIRPLANE WITH A clear visualflightrules AREA HE MADE A baddecision.I SPOKE WITH THE skydive LATER AND TOLD HIM HE COULD NOT JUMP AND VIOLATE THE federalaviationregulation.HE WAS ALSO TOLD TO WAIT UNTIL THE pilot give THE SIGNAL.THE skydive WAS final TOLD THAT ANOTHER INCIDENT WOULD ground HIM permanent.
948~WHILE ON AN instrumentflightrulesflight PLAN FROM _ WE deviate _ degree FROM OUR assignedheading.WE WERE IN THE descend PHASE ABOUT _ mile FROM CRQ.IT WAS THE firstofficer south LEG AND I WAS admire THE scene ON A beauty CAVU morn.WE HAD BEEN give sever LARGE vector DUE TO traffic.AS WE GOT close TO CRQ WE GOT assign A left TURN OF ABOUT _ degree.AT THIS TIME WE WERE give OUR expect runwayassignment.I move THE headingbug TO THE assignedheading THEN I proceed TO PROGRAM THE flightmanagementsystem FOR THE APPROPRIATE runway.WHEN I look DOWN TO WORK ON THE flightmanagementsystem I DID NOT REALIZE THE firstofficer WAS STILL look FOR A PARTICULAR PIECE OF scene THAT I HAD try TO POINT OUR early.HE continue PAST OUR assignedheading ABOUT _ degree.WHEN I look UP FROM THE flightmanagementsystem I call THE deviate TO hi attention.HE immediate execute A _ degree BANK turnback TO THE PROPER head.THE control query US AT THIS TIME AND WE TOLD HIM WE WERE correct.THERE WAS NO OTHER aircraft IN THE immediatearea.I BELIEVE THIS deviate WAS cause BY A LACK OF communicate between THE firstofficer AND MYSELF AND A preoccupy WITH flightmanagementsystem program THAT WASN T entire NECESSARY.I SHOULD HAVE LET MY firstofficer KNOW THAT I WAS HEAD DOWN AND I SHOULD HAVE NOT focus ALL OF MY attention ON THE flightmanagementsystem.I HAVE learn THAT special WHEN IN UNFAMILIAR place IT IS IMPERATIVE TO LEAVE ALL sightsee TO THE passenger UNTIL ALL OTHER duty ARE DONE.do TOO MANY headsdown thing CLOSE TO THE airport make US MUCH MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO STUPID mistake special IN GREAT weather.
949~WE WERE land ON runway _ IN BOSTON.THE weather WAS clear visualflightrules BUT WITH gustywind.THE land result IN A HIGH BOUNCE FROM WHICH WE elect TO goaraound.ALTHOUGH AN UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCE THE transit TO THE goaraound WENT WELL.HOWEVER AS PER USUAL ZBW procedure ANOTHER aircraft A SAAB _ HAD depart runway create A converge CONFLICT WITH A miss approach goaraound SIT OF runway _.AS WE commence THE goaraound bos airport tower immediate issue US A TURN TO _ degree.THIS remind US OF THE FACT WE D see AND comment ON THE SAAB IN posit ON runway AS WE approach runway _ AND THE POTENTIAL OF CONFLICT SHOULD WE MISS AND THEY takeoff.WE commence AN assert left TURN AND CONTINUATION OF OUR climb.ALTHOUGH NO trafficalertandcollisionavoidancesystem _ ALERT TOOK PLACE TOO LOW FOR activate A QUICK GLANCE OF CONCERN TO THE trafficalertandcollisionavoidancesystem _ show A TARGET near UNDER US BY A MERE _ feet.THIS add VIGOR TO OUR MANEUVER.WE ALSO ask THE tower WHERE THE SAAB WAS THEY say IT WAS go STRAIGHT OUT AND NOT A FACTOR.settle DOWN WE MADE A NICE VISUAL approach AND land TO runway _.AN AIRBUS _ WAS ALSO ON A landandholdshortoperations approach TO runway HOLD SHORT OF runway _ IMAGINE IF THEY D miss approach TOO.obvious THE goaraound WAS UNUSUAL AND concern TO THE passenger SOME comment THAT THEY D see THE OTHER aircraft AND IT WAS CLOSE.quit A FEW WERE ALSO AND understand scare.WE MADE APPROPRIATE followup PA announcement.SUMMARY FROM A pilot south POINT OF VIEW THE BOUNCE AND goaraound ALTHOUGH NOT COMMON WAS straightforward AND WELL UNDER control.OUR MAIN CONCERN CAME FROM THE CLOSE VICINITY OF THE aircraft depart OFF runway AND THE FACT THAT THE SEQUENCE OF runway _ land WITH runway departure WILL RESULT IN TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT SITS SHOULD THERE BE A runway _ goaraound.THESE SITS NEED BE resequence TO CONSIDER goaround TOO OR ELSE IT seem ONLY A MATTER OF TIME.callbackconversation WITH report _ reveal THE followinginformation THE aircraft WAS turn SO THAT IT DID NOT PASS runway miss THE SAAB BY ABOUT _ feet horizontal.THE captain HAD take OVER THE control AND MADE A TIGHT TURN TO THE assignedheading OF _ degree TO KEEP THE flight AWAY FROM THE SAAB WHICH WAS ON A runwayheading OF _ degree BELOW THEM.THE firstofficer report THAT THIS procedure HAS BEEN IN us FOR sometime AT bos airport.HE state THAT THE pilotincommand DID TALK WITH THE FACILITY CHIEF BUT doe NOT KNOW WHAT transpire.THE captain ALSO turn IN A COMPANY report BUT SO FAR AS HE know DID NOT report THIS TO THE UNION.THE firstofficer WAS counsel TO DO SO.on problem WITH THIS procedure IS THAT THE _ aircraft WERE ON SEPARATE frequency THE SAAB ON _ AND THE _ ON _.WITH depart jettraffic THERE IS NOT A CONFLICT ON A NORMAL goaraound FROM runway _ AND A depart FROM runway AS THE JET UNLESS VERY LIGHT WOULD BE WELL UNDER THE flight PATH OF A goaraound aircraft FROM runway _.THE OTHER problem IS THAT THE turboprop LIKE THE SAAB ARE lift OFF soon climb OUT ON runwayheading AND doe CREATE A CONFLICT AREA WITH ani aircraft ON THE goaraound FROM runway _.
950~BEFORE depart stl airport WE WERE give A clearance BY stl airport clearancedelivery TO MAINTAIN _ feet.AFTER depart stl airport enroute TO xna airport stl airport depart clear US TO _ feetmeansealevel AND TO MAINTAIN A head OF _ degree.DURING OUR climbout THE departurecontroller advise US OF traffic AT _ o'clock posit AND _ feet.SINCE WE WERE IN instrumentmeteorologicalconditions AND I THE firstofficer WAS THE pilotflying THE captain monitor THE traffic ON THE trafficalertandcollisionavoidancesystem _.AS WE continue OUR climb TO _ feetmeansealevel THE traffic ON THE trafficalertandcollisionavoidancesystem _ change FROM A trafficadvisory TO AN resolutionadvisory AND IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THE OTHER aircraft WAS NOT AT _ feetmeansealevel.AT approximate _ feetmeansealevel THE captain TOOK control OF OUR aircraft AND PUT IT IN A right turn descend.WHEN WE WERE clear OF THE OTHER aircraft WE continue OUR climb BACK TO _ feetmeansealevel AND THE remain OF THE flight continue uneventful.
951~lax airport tower GAVE US AN altitude OF _ feet.WE overshoot _ feet AND WHEN warninghorn sound begin A descend BACK TO _ feet.control THEN ask OUR altitude AND WHEN WE reply WE WERE descend BACK TO _ feet HE clear US TO _ feet.
